# Raw Images

This folder contains image files which are not suitable for usage directly on the website
(e.g. large SVG images which might need to be exported first, or GIMP editable files
which aren't supported on the internet).

If you edit one of the files here it won't be used directly on the website - instead, you'll
need to copy it into `public/images/`
