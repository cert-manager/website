    - title: Kubernetes allows you to run your Infrastructure like Google.
      img: /img/jpg/kubernetes-1.jpg
      desc: >
        Today’s applications are increasingly complex systems that need to be updated at a pace that matches our desire to iterate and innovate.


        Building apps using Linux Containers like Docker helps immensely with the deployment of code, as they are easily portable. However, once you’ve got lots of Containers, it soon becomes hard work to co-ordinate the sprawl, and importantly, keep them production grade.

    - title: Built on a foundation of Success and Scale
      img: /img/jpg/kubernetes-2.jpg
      desc: >
        For more than 10 years, Google has run their company on Containers. In response to the growing popularity of Docker and related technologies, they lifted the lid on their internal Borg system in a research paper. This once-secret sauce runs Google’s entire infrastructure, managing vast server clusters across the globe – a tool that until not long ago was never mentioned, even as a code name.

    - title: Enter Kubernetes
      img: /img/jpg/kubernetes-3.jpg
      desc: >
        Impressively, Google went a step further and kicked off an open source implementation of their container management system. This became Kubernetes which was launched in 2014. Importantly, Kubernetes implements lessons learned in using these systems at massive scale in production, and the response has been breathtaking. A look at their Github profile tells you all you need to know about its interest and adoption.

      - title: Enables Scale
        img: /img/png/icon-scale.png
        desc: Designed on the same principles that allows Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your ops team.
      - title: Suitable for simple and complex workloads
        img: /img/png/icon-workloads.png
        desc: Whether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.
      - title: Enables Scale
        img: /img/png/icon-portable.png
        desc: Kubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premise, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.
