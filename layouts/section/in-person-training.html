          <p class="black"><strong>Kubernetes Beginner - One Day</strong><br />
          <strong>Kubernetes Intermediate - One Day</strong><br />
          <strong>Kubernetes Advanced Operations - One Day</strong></p>

          <p>These are hands-on modular courses that will train you in deploying Kubernetes and operating it efficiently, whatever your level of experience.</p>
          <p> Jetstack’s training courses draw from experience of deploying Kubernetes for clients. They are very interactive, and give you the chance to explore key areas of interest.</p>

        <h2>Beginner:</h2>
        <p>You will learn how to deploy a microservices application to Google Container Engine (GKE). We will explain the core concepts of Kubernetes and give hands-on, instructor-led labs that cover topics such as persistent volume types, application logs, and using Helm to package and deploy applications.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day you will also see Continu- ous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) on Kubernetes, as an application is deployed into multiple environments before being rolled out to production.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2>Intermediate:</h2>
        <p>We will demonstrate some of the more advanced features of Kubernetes and how you can use them to reduce the operational burden on your team. We will give hands-on, instructor-led labs that cover topics such as auto-scaling, the control plane, Ingress and StatefulSet.</p>
        <p>You will also get to set up a CI/CD pipeline running on Kubernetes, deploying to multiple environments with Helm. We will introduce cluster federation and see a federated, multi-region cluster in action using an example microservices demo application compared to your peers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2>Advanced:</h2>
        <p>You will learn about pushing the boundaries of Kubernetes by focusing on advanced features and doing a deep dive of the internals. You will get a flavour of what it's like to be responsible for a cluster at scale, hearing about SRE best-practice at Google..</p>
        <p>Then, how would you fare whilst operating Kubernetes under pressure? Find out in our team 'Wargaming' exercise. As part of the challenge, we will break your Kubernetes cluster in a series of different ways, leaving you and your teammates to figure out how to fix it.</p>
        <p>Note: Scenarios are based on real-world Kubernetes issues faced by Jetstack engineers.</p>
