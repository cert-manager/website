# As per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280, the spelling "X.509" is the
# correct spelling. The spelling "x509" and "X509" are incorrect.

X.509

# Since the Markdown files in content/*-docs are copied over from the
# cert-manager repository using fixed tags, we can't expect these files to
# contain the right X.509 spelling. The following is a series of exceptions
# so that the x509 spelling is accepted in those files.
