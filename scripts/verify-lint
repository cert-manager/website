# About "!content/en/next-docs/**/*.md":
#
# mdspell can fail on master due to words that have been added to the
# release-next branch and aren't on master yet. Since we pull the release-next
# branch into content/en/next-docs, the yet-to-be-ignored words are unknown to
# mdspell.
#
# As an example, the PR https://github.com/cert-manager/website/pull/570 added
# the new spellings "andreas-p" and "renewBefore" to the release-next branch.
# After the merge, all builds on master started failing since "andreas-p" and
# "renewBefore" were not present on the master branch's .spelling file.
