# Default docs params

# Doc versions params
# Create a separate [[versions]] set for every version / doc set branch
# Use the ghbranchname param for specifying the GitHub branchname ->
# Example:
#   [thisisalink](https://github.com/.../tree/{{< params "ghbranchname" >}}/...)
#
# [[versions]] - Defines a single "version" of the docs
#   version - Intuitive version label (ie. visible in menus)
#   ghbranchname - Name of branch of the doc version in GitHub
#                  (https://github.com/cert-manager/docs/branches)
#   url - Fully qualified website URL to the doc version
#         (ie. https://cert-manager.io/[dirpath])
#   dirpath - The content folder name of the doc version
#           - Latest release is always set to "docs"
#           - Past/archived releases change to "v#.#-docs",
#             where # is the MAJOR and MINOR semantic version values
