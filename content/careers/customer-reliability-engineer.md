With an in-depth understanding of Kubernetes cluster internals, we provide the safe pair of hands and confidence to ensure that that customers’ clusters are robust, efficient and scalable. CREs are a point of contact and seek pragmatic resolutions to complex systems issues, working closely with customers and internal teams.
