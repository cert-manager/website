We guide and support enterprises in their adoption and production use of Kubernetes. Our deep understanding and real-world experience in a variety of environments (cloud and on-premise), enables us to accelerate customer projects and provide them with confidence in their operations.

* Tooling around Kubernetes (<a href="https://github.com/jetstack/tarmak">Tarmak</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/navigator">Navigator</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">Cert-Manager</a>)
* Contribution to the Kubernetes project
* Workshop exercises and slides for our training programmes
* Documentation of our projects
* Support to customer projects

Basically, a bit of everything!

* Experience of Python / Ruby / C/C++ and/or Go (ideal)
* Experience of cloud technology (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, OpenStack etc)
* Experience of Linux and systems programming (i.e. shell, Bash scripting, etc)
* Experience of Linux containers (i.e. Docker)
* Experience of Git source control
* Ideally doing a CS/Maths/Engineering degree, or recently graduated from one (although thatâ€™s not essential).
