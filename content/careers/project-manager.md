We are a fast-growing Kubernetes company with offices in London, Bristol and the
Midlands. We pride ourselves on helping startups and enterprises alike in their
path to modern cloud-native infrastructure.

We have three major products:

- Subscription (Kubernetes support and access to Jetstack Flightdeck)
- Training (both in-person and via Flightdeck)
- Consulting and engineering

We also have a number of very active and successful open source projects which
form a key part of the Kubernetes ecosystem.

Our deep understanding and real-world experience in a variety of environments
(cloud and on-premise), enable us to accelerate customer projects and provide
them with confidence in their operations.
