We guide and support enterprises in their adoption and production use of Kubernetes. Our deep understanding and real-world experience in a variety of environments (cloud and on-premises), enables us to accelerate customer projects and provide them with confidence in their operations.

**The Role** 

Due to increased interest in Kubernetes adoption, we are looking for a Business Development Manager to help build our brand by selling Jetstack’s services and working closely with our major partners (namely Google Cloud and Venafi). As a Business Development Manager, you will identify, build and nurture lasting relationships with new and existing customers. You’ll work closely with our Co-Founders and Engineers to develop our sales pipeline and strategy.

Jetstack already has an established reputation within the Kubernetes community and we receive a high number of warm leads; we’re not looking for someone to spend hours on the phone cold-calling! What we do need however, is someone with an interest in cloud-technologies and a desire to help deliver real value to our customers.

**What will you be doing** 

* Responsible for driving new business by identifying, prospecting, closing and onboarding customers
* Build a strategy to grow our current accounts and acquire new ones. Our subscription product has huge potential within the industry, so we would like you to develop this pipeline in particular.
* Develop relationships with key stakeholders and our network of partners to increase our customers ROI
* Define Jetstack’s relationships within accounts, such as executing business reviews and maintaining customer satisfaction
* Assisting with our marketing and PR using social media and events

**What are we looking for** 

* Sales/account management experience, ideally within a startup 
* Excellent networking and negotiating abilities
* A proven track-record of achieving and exceeding sales targets and KPI’s
* An ability to effectively prioritise business-critical opportunities
* We use Pipedrive to keep track of our funnel, so experience with this platform would be great
* Understanding of open source and cloud technologies
