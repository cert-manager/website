We guide and support enterprises in their adoption and production use of Kubernetes. Our deep understanding and real-world experience in a variety of environments (cloud and on-premise), enables us to accelerate customer projects and provide them with confidence in their operations.

Our Operations Engineers provide pro-active support and maintenance to Jetstack customers. These customers now increasingly use Kubernetes as a platform for their highly-scalable, user-facing workloads, and uptime and performance are critical. With an in-depth understanding of Kubernetes cluster internals, we provide customers with a safe pair of hands and the confidence that their clusters are robust, efficient and scalable. Operations Engineers are a point of contact and seek pragmatic resolution to complex systems issues, working closely with customers and internal teams.
