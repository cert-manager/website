We are looking for an in-house Recruitment Consultant to lead our talent acquisition strategy.

The company has grown organically to 18 people. Recently Kubernetes has become one of the most active open source projects in the world, and we need someone to help us scale the team to meet the demands of our growing list of customers and the evolving complexity of our projects.

You will be responsible for the whole range of roles across the company, from technical to commercial. As an engineering-lead company, we need someone who is interested in the technology space and comfortable working in a fast-paced market.

**What we are looking for:**

* 2+ years’ experience in recruitment, ideally with a background of hiring in the tech/digital industry
* Knowledge of open source
* The ability to work autonomously, building and leading the company’s recruitment process
* A strong communicator, who is able to confidently deliver our message to candidates
* Someone who can represent the company well and has a passion for our brand
* Someone keen to learn about the space and hungry to find profiles that fit our business

**Role will entail:**

* Being responsible for setting and achieving annual hiring numbers
* Building strong relationships within the tech community
* Representing the company at industry events and meetups
* Implementing a consistent and robust recruitment process

The successful candidate will be given a high level of autonomy and responsibility, and so must be self-motivated.
