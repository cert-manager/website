We guide and support enterprises in their adoption and production use of Kubernetes. Our deep understanding and real-world experience in a variety of environments (cloud and on-premise), enables us to accelerate customer projects and provide them with confidence in their operations.

Our Solution Engineers architect, design and implement Kubernetes-based integrations. They work directly with customers, onsite and remote, and are as comfortable in front of a whiteboard explaining concepts to a customer as at a Linux terminal implementing highly-automated and scripted solutions. They understand how to integrate and make the most of Kubernetes and related cloud-native technology. They have a passion for pushing boundaries, sometimes with novel and experimental ideas, are self-started and proactive.

**Technology experience**

* Python / Ruby / C/C++ and/or Go (ideal)
* Cloud technology (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, OpenStack etc)
* Linux and systems programming (i.e. shell, Bash scripting, etc)
* Linux containers (Docker, rkt etc)
* Git source control
* CI / CD (e.g. GitLab, Jenkins etc)

**We look for**

* A proven track record of helping customers succeed, ideally in an enterprise setting.
* Interest in working with a cutting edge technology in fast-growing open source communities
* Willingness to engage directly with customers on-site in a variety of environments with different operational constraints
* Passion to learn in a fast-moving space
* Ability to ‘think on your feet’ and react appropriately to challenges
* A ‘can do’ attitude with a desire to experiment with solutions
* Ability to communicate effectively with customers, including management at all levels, as well as engineering teams
* Willingness to travel (up to 50%) - primarily in the UK but also across Europe from time to time
