Companies often have to run stateful services out-of-cluster, leading to awkward architecture decisions. Navigator is a Kubernetes-native Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS). It enables stateful services to be deployed as first-class citizens in Kubernetes, meaning a consistent deployment experience for stateless and stateful services alike.
