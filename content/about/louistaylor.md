Louis has been active in the open source community for a number of years, particularly with OpenStack and surrounding projects. He previously worked for HP, where he spent a lot of time working with Kubernetes, and is looking forward to getting more experience working with the Jetstack team on both new and ongoing projects. In his spare time he enjoys writing questionable Python code and tinkering with sailing robots.
