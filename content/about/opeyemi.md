Opey is an undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of
Goldsmiths, currently working at Jetstack as an intern over the summer. Although
he is completely new to the world of Kubernetes, he's in the best place to learn
and grow! When he's not off at University studying, he's spending his time off creating
fantasy basketball teams.
