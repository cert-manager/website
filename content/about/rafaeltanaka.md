Rafael started his career in the tech industry later in life, after 5 years as a Linux Enginner at Jetstack he was able to marry his passion for teaching and innovative technologies such as Kubernetes. He is always coming with different ideas on how to explain the wonders of Kubernetes to anyone that will listen. You will probably never see him without a big smile across his face. According to him smiling makes you happy and being happy makes you smile. He has been trapped in that cycle since he was a kid.
