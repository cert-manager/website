Hannah has a background in Ancient languages and Linguistics, and recently completed a postgrad at UCL. She holds an English language teaching qualification, and has experience working both abroad in Rome and in UK universities. She became interested in working in tech during her postgraduate year after attending courses run by Code First: Girls, and using her linguistic knowledge to aid a machine-learning project for another London start-up. She is looking forward to learning from the team and helping to manage training workshops and Kubernetes projects both internally and for clients.
