Matt’s background is in solutions for the acquisition, management and exploitation of large-scale data. Since its launch, he has contributed widely to the Kubernetes project, both to the technology and to the ecosystem. He was an early employee at NoSQL startup MongoDB, and previously at Deutsche Telekom R&D and Detica. When he’s not talking Kubernetes, he loves cycling and spending time with his family.
