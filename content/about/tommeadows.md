Tom is an engineer with a passion for computers that spans back to his childhood. He relishes new challenges both on and off the computer, but has a particular interest in finding ways to showcase the beauty of the enterprise solutions that keep the world spinning.

After completing a degree in Electronic Engineering, Tom has spent time working at some of the worlds leading enterprise technology corporations, before finding Kubernetes and the Cloud Native Landscape as a specific area in which to focus. At Jetstack he is looking for opportunities to learn more about open-source platforms and tooling, whilst also finding ways to contribute back.

In his free time, Tom enjoys listening to Electronic Music (hence ChaosInTheCRD), running and coffee. He is even known to occasionally do all three at the same time.
