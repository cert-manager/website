Matt has been a part of the open source industry for over ten years. He was an early employee at Ubuntu, where he lead their OEM business in Asia, before moving to Corporate Services in Europe. He spent a number of years with NoSQL vendor MongoDB where he ran Public Sector. He caught the container bug early, and started Jetstack with Matt to help people take advantage of them.
