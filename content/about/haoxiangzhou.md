Haoxiang is currently a third year Computer Science student at Imperial College London, joining
Jetstack for a six-months internship. He has dabbled in web application and
deep learning projects, but this internship has been his first opportunity to dive right
into the world of Kubernetes. Apropos diving in, to relax, Haoxiang likes to go for a swim.
