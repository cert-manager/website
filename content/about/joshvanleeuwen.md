Josh is an undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of Bristol, currently working at Jetstack as an intern over the summer period. Although he is relatively new to the world of Kubernetes, he's in the best place to learn! When he's not busy with studies he's dabbling in Linux and making good food.
