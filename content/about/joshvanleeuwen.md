Josh is an undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of Bristol as well as working part time at Jetstack. He interned over the summer, working mostly on the project vault-helper - a tool to automate PKI tasks, now integrated into Tarmak. Although he is relatively new to the world of Kubernetes, he's in the best place to learn! When he's not busy with studies he's dabbling in Linux and making good food.
