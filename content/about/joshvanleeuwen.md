Josh interned at Jetstack during the summer of 2017 before continuing to work
part time during his final year of study at the University of Bristol.  During
this year, Josh developed a Kubernetes custom controller that automates the
delegation of RBAC permissions based on time and event triggers. This work was
later awarded the best Software Development Tool Final Year Project. Josh now
works full time at Jetstack where if he's not writing more Go, he's making good
food.
