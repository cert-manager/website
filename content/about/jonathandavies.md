Jonathan has been working on open-source for more than 10 years. He spent a
number of years working for Canonical where he assisted customers with Ubuntu
deployments across the spectrum of desktop, server and cloud infrastuctures.
He's dived into the fascinating world of Kubernetes, and when he isn't tinkering
with it at home, he can be found on a mountain on skis.
