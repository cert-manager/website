The kind (Kubernetes-In-Docker) project virtualizes entire multi-node Kubernetes
clusters in containers to allow for a lightweight deployment topology in order
to facilitate testing. This presentation will explore how the kind project is
used to support testing for the Kubernetes project, how it works, and how
developers can make use of kind to facilitate their own testing needs.
