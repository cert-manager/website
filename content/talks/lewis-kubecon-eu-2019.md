In 2018, two people from Wales, United Kingdom decided to bring the
CNCF to their doorstep.

Previously, they were attending international conferences and national meetups
to meet and be a part of the community.

Knowing that they were in a privileged position, they wanted to share it with
others that, for whatever reason, were unable to make these events.

Cloud Native Wales will be soon celebrating a year of meetups, and best of all,
we get to share this with the 100's of people within our meetup community.

This talk will inspire you to take the chance to branch the CNCF and build a
community closer to home, help others learn, share and contribute to the world
wide community.
