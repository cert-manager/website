<div className="info">

ðŸ“Œ  This page focuses on solving ACME HTTP-01 challenges. If you are looking for
how to automatically create Certificate resources by annotating Ingress or
Gateway resources, see [Securing Ingress Resources](../../../usage/ingress.md) and
[Securing Gateway Resources](../../../usage/gateway.md).

</div>

cert-manager uses your existing Ingress or Gateway configuration in order to
solve HTTP01 challenges.


## Configuring the HTTP01 Ingress solver

This page contains details on the different options available on the `Issuer`
resource's HTTP01 challenge solver configuration. For more information on
configuring ACME issuers and their API format, read the [ACME Issuers](../README.md)
documentation.

You can read about how the HTTP01 challenge type works on the [Let's Encrypt
challenge types
page](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge).

Here is an example of a simple `HTTP01` ACME issuer with more options for
configuration below:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: example-issuer
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: example-issuer-account-key
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
```

## Options

The HTTP01 Issuer supports a number of additional options.  For full details on
the range of options available, read the [reference
documentation](../../../reference/api-docs.md#acme.cert-manager.io/v1.ACMEChallengeSolverHTTP01).

### `class`

If the `class` field is specified, cert-manager will create new `Ingress`
resources in order to route traffic to the `acmesolver` pods, which are
responsible for responding to ACME challenge validation requests.

If this field is not specified, and `name` is also not specified,
cert-manager will default to create *new* `Ingress` resources but will **not**
set the ingress class on these resources, meaning *all* ingress controllers
installed in your cluster will serve traffic for the challenge solver,
potentially incurring additional cost.


### `name`

If the `name` field is specified, cert-manager will edit the named
ingress resource in order to solve HTTP01 challenges.

This is useful for compatibility with ingress controllers such as `ingress-gce`,
which utilize a unique IP address for each `Ingress` resource created.

This mode should be avoided when using ingress controllers that expose a single
IP for all ingress resources, as it can create compatibility problems with
certain ingress-controller specific annotations.

<h3 id="ingress-service-type">`serviceType`</h3>

In rare cases it might be not possible/desired to use `NodePort` as type for the
HTTP01 challenge response service, e.g. because of Kubernetes limit
restrictions. To define which Kubernetes service type to use during challenge
response specify the following HTTP01 configuration:

```yaml
    http01:
      ingress:
        # Valid values are ClusterIP and NodePort
        serviceType: ClusterIP
```

By default, type `NodePort` will be used when you don't set HTTP01 or when you set
`serviceType` to an empty string. Normally there's no need to change this.


### `podTemplate`

You may wish to change or add to the labels and annotations of solver pods.
These can be configured under the `metadata` field under `podTemplate`.

Similarly, you can set the `nodeSelector`, tolerations and affinity of solver
pods by configuring under the `spec` field of the `podTemplate`. No other
spec fields can be edited.

An example of how you could configure the template is as so:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: ...
spec:
  acme:
    server: ...
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: ...
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          podTemplate:
            metadata:
              labels:
                foo: "bar"
                env: "prod"
            spec:
              nodeSelector:
                bar: baz
```

The added labels and annotations will merge on top of the cert-manager defaults,
overriding entries with the same key.

No other fields of the `podTemplate` exist.

### `ingressTemplate`

It is possible to add labels and annotations to the solver ingress resources.
It can be really useful when you are managing several Ingress Controllers across your cluster and you want to make sure that the right one will pick up and expose the solver (for the upcoming challenge to resolve).
These can be configured under the `metadata` field under `ingressTemplate`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: ...
spec:
  acme:
    server: ...
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: ...
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          ingressTemplate:
            metadata:
              labels:
                foo: "bar"
              annotations:
                "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-source-range": "0.0.0.0/0,::/0"
                "nginx.org/mergeable-ingress-type": "minion"
                "traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/frontend-entry-points": "http"
```

The added labels and annotations will merge on top of the cert-manager defaults,
overriding entries with the same key.

No other fields of the ingress can be edited.

## Configuring the HTTP-01 Gateway API solver

**FEATURE STATE**: cert-manager 1.5 [alpha]

The Gateway and HTTPRoute resources are part of the [Gateway API][gwapi], a set
of CRDs that you install on your Kubernetes cluster that provide various
improvements over the Ingress API.

[gwapi]: https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io

<div className="info">

ðŸ“Œ  This feature requires the installation of the [Gateway API bundle](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-a-gateway-controller) and passing a
feature flag to the cert-manager controller.

To install v1.5.1 Gateway API bundle (Gateway CRDs and webhook), run the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v0.5.1/standard-install.yaml"
```

To enable the feature in cert-manager, turn on the `GatewayAPI` feature gate:

- If you are using Helm:

  ```sh
  helm upgrade --install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager \
    --set "extraArgs={--feature-gates=ExperimentalGatewayAPISupport=true}"
  ```

- If you are using the raw cert-manager manifests, add the following flag to the
  cert-manager controller Deployment:

  ```yaml
  args:
    - --feature-gates=ExperimentalGatewayAPISupport=true
  ```

The Gateway API CRDs should either be installed before cert-manager starts or
the cert-manager Deployment should be restarted after installing the Gateway API
CRDs. This is important because some of the cert-manager components only perform
the Gateway API check on startup. You can restart cert-manager with the
following command:

```sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment cert-manager -n cert-manager
```

</div>


<div className="info">

ðŸš§   cert-manager 1.8+ is tested with v1alpha2 Kubernetes Gateway API. It should also work
with v1beta1 because of resource conversion, but has not been tested with it.
</div>

The Gateway API HTTPRoute HTTP-01 solver creates a temporary HTTPRoute using the
given labels. These labels must match a Gateway that contains a listener on port
80.

Here is an example of a HTTP-01 ACME Issuer using the Gateway API:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt
  namespace: default
spec:
  acme:
    solvers:
      - http01:
          gatewayHTTPRoute:
            parentRefs:
              - name: traefik
                namespace: traefik
                kind: Gateway
```

The Issuer relies on an existing Gateway present on the cluster. cert-manager
does not edit Gateway resources.

For example, the following Gateway will allow the Issuer to solve the challenge:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: traefik
  namespace: traefik
spec:
  gatewayClassName: traefik
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
    allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: All
```

In the above example, the Gateway has been specifically created for the purpose
of solving HTTP-01 challenges, but you can also choose to re-use your existing
Gateway, as long as it has a listener on port 80.

The `labels` on your Issuer may reference a Gateway that is on a separate
namespace, as long as the Gateway's port 80 listener is configured with `from:
All`. Note that the Certificate will still be created on the same namespace as
the Issuer, which means that you won't be able to reference this Secret in the
above-mentioned Gateway.

When the above Issuer is presented with a Certificate, cert-manager creates the
temporary HTTPRoute. For example, with the following Certificate:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: example-tls
  namespace: default
spec:
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt
  dnsNames:
  - example.net
```

You will see an HTTPRoute appear:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: cm-acme-http-solver-gdhvg
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: traefik
      namespace: traefik
      kind: Gateway
  hostnames:
  - example.net
  rules:
  - forwardTo:
    - port: 8089
      serviceName: cm-acme-http-solver-gdhvg
      weight: 1
    matches:
    - path:
        type: Exact
        value: /.well-known/acme-challenge/YadC4gaAzqEPU1Yea0D2MrzvNRWiBCtUizCtpiRQZqI
```

After the Certificate is issued, the HTTPRoute is deleted.

<h3 id="gatewayhttproute-labels">`labels`</h3>

These labels are copied into the temporary HTTPRoute created by cert-manager for
solving the HTTP-01 challenge. These labels must match one of the Gateway
resources on your cluster. The matched Gateway have a listener on port 80.

Note that when the labels do not match any Gateway on your cluster, cert-manager
will create the temporary HTTPRoute challenge and nothing will happen.

<h3 id="gatewayhttproute-service-type">`serviceType`</h3>

This field has the same meaning as the
[`http01.ingress.serviceType`](#ingress-service-type).


## Setting Nameservers for HTTP-01 solver propagation checks

cert-manager will perform reachability tests before attempting a HTT01
challenge.  By default cert-manager will use the recursive nameservers taken
from `/etc/resolv.conf` to query the challenge URL.

If this is not desired (for example with split-horizon DNS), the cert-manager
controller exposes a flag that allows you alter this behavior:

`--acme-http01-solver-nameservers` Comma separated string with host and port of the
recursive nameservers cert-manager should query.


Example usage:
```bash
--acme-http01-solver-nameservers="8.8.8.8:53,1.1.1.1:53"
```

If you're using the `cert-manager` helm chart, you can set recursive nameservers
through `.Values.extraArgs` or at the command at helm install/upgrade time
with `--set`:

```bash
--set 'extraArgs={--acme-http01-solver-nameservers=8.8.8.8:53\,1.1.1.1:53}'
```
