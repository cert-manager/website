If running Kubernetes versions before `v1.22`, the
[`ServerSideApply`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/)
feature gate _must_ be enabled in the cluster. This beta feature is enabled by default
on supported versions before `v1.22`.

From here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](../../installation/upgrade.md).
