title: Release 1.18
description: 'cert-manager release notes: cert-manager 1.18'
---

cert-manager is the easiest way to automatically manage certificates in Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.

cert-manager 1.18 introduces several new features and breaking changes.
Highlights include support for ACME certificate profiles,
a new default for `Certificate.Spec.PrivateKey.RotationPolicy` now set to `Always` (breaking change), and
the default `Certificate.Spec.RevisionHistoryLimit` now set to `1` (potentially breaking).
Be sure to review all new features and changes below, and read the full release notes carefully before upgrading.

## Major Themes

### OperatorHub Packages Discontinued

We no longer publish OperatorHub packages for cert-manager.
Why? Because the cert-manager maintainers no longer have the time or resources to maintain and test those packages.
cert-manager `v1.16.5` is the last release on OperatorHub.

>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è [cert-manager `v1.16.5` for `operatorhub.io`](https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators/tree/main/operators/cert-manager/1.16.5).

### ACME HTTP01 challenge paths now use `PathType` `Exact` in Ingress routes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking change

We have changed the `PathType` for ACME HTTP01 Ingress-based challenges to `Exact`.
This security feature ensures that the challenge path (which is an exact path)
is not misinterpreted as a regular expression or some other Ingress-specific
(`ImplementationSpecific`) parsing.
This allows HTTP01 challenges to be solved when using standards compliant
Ingress controllers such as Cilium.

This change is incompatible with certain versions and configurations of the `ingress-nginx` Ingress controller.
Versions of [`ingress-nginx >=1.8.0`](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/changelog/controller-1.8.0.md) support a [`strict-validate-path-type` configuration option](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#strict-validate-path-type) which, when enabled, disallows `.` (dot) in the path value. This is a [bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/11176) which makes it impossible to use various legitimate URL paths, including the  `http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/.well-known/acme-challenge/<TOKEN>` URLs used for [ACME HTTP01](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge).
To make matters worse, the buggy validation is [enabled by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/11819) in [`ingress-nginx >= 1.12.0`](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/changelog/controller-1.12.0.md).
You will see errors like this in the cert-manager controller logs:

> Error presenting challenge: admission webhook `validate.nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io` denied the request: ingress contains invalid paths: path `/.well-known/acme-challenge/oTw4h9_WsobTRn5COTSyaiAx3aWn0M7_aYisoz1gXQw` cannot be used with `pathType` Exact

If you use `ingress-nginx`, choose **one** of the following two options:

#### Option 1. Disable the `ACMEHTTP01IngressPathTypeExact` feature in cert-manager

To disable the `ACMEHTTP01IngressPathTypeExact` feature,
to reinstate the old `PathType: ImplementationSpecific` behavior,
use the following Helm values when installing cert-manager:

```yaml
# values.yaml
config:
  featureGates:
    # Disable the use of Exact PathType in Ingress resources, to work around a bug in ingress-nginx
    # https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/11176
    ACMEHTTP01IngressPathTypeExact: false
```

#### Option 2. Disable the `strict-validate-path-type` option in ingress-nginx

To disable the buggy strict path validation,
use the following Helm values when installing `ingress-nginx`:

```yaml
# values.yaml
controller:
  config:
    # Disable strict path validation, to work around a bug in ingress-nginx
    # https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/11176
    strict-validate-path-type: false
```

#### Option 3. Upgrade `ingress-nginx`

This issue is resolved in `ingress-nginx` versions `v1.13.2` and `v1.12.6`, both released on August 29, 2025.

If you are running ingress-nginx `v1.13.2+` or `v1.12.6+`, you do not need to apply the workarounds described above.  

See the [fix commit](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/commit/618aae18515213bcf3fb820e6f8c234703d844b2)  

### ACME Certificate Profiles

cert-manager now supports the selection of ACME certificate profiles, allowing
users to request different categories of certificates from their ACME
Certificate Authority.
This enhancement leverages the latest [ACME protocol extension for certificate profiles (IETF draft)][rfc] and is supported by Let's Encrypt and other providers.
For example, Let's Encrypt offers the [`tlsserver`][tlsserver] profile for
standard server certificates and the [`shortlived`][shortlived] profile for
short-lived six-day certificates.
These new options provide users with greater flexibility and improved security
for their certificate management needs.

[rfc]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aaron-acme-profiles/
[tlsserver]: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/profiles/#tlsserver
[shortlived]: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/profiles/#shortlived

### The default value of `Certificate.Spec.PrivateKey.RotationPolicy` is now `Always`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking change

We have changed the default value of `Certificate.Spec.PrivateKey.RotationPolicy` from `Never` to `Always`.

Why? Because the old default was unintuitive and insecure.
For example, if a private key is exposed, users may (reasonably) assume that
re-issuing a certificate (e.g. using `cmctl renew`) will generate a new private
key, but it won't unless the user has explicitly set `rotationPolicy: Always` on the Certificate resource.

This change is feature gated and is enabled by default, because it has been fast-tracked to beta status.

Users who want to preserve the old default have two options:
1. Explicitly set `rotationPolicy: Never` on your Certificate resources.
2. Turn off the feature gate in this release and explicitly set
   `rotationPolicy: Never` on your Certificates before release 1.19.
   In release 1.19, the feature will be marked as GA and it will no longer be
   possible to turn off the feature.

The following Helm chart values can be used to turn off the feature gate:

```yaml
# values.yaml
config:
  featureGates:
    DefaultPrivateKeyRotationPolicyAlways: false
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The old default value `Never` was always intended to be changed before API `v1`, as can be seen in the description of the [original PR](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/2814):
> > For backward compatibility, the empty value is treated as 'Never' which matches the behavior we have today.
> > In a future API version, we can flip this default to be Always.
>
> üìñ See [Issue: 7601: Change `PrivateKey.RotationPolicy` to default to Always](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/7601) to read the proposal for this change and the discussion around it.
>
> üìñ Read [cert-manager component configuration](../../installation/configuring-components.md) to learn more about feature gates.
>
> üìñ Read our updated [API compatibility statement](../../contributing/api-compatibility.md) which now reflects our new, more flexible, approach to changing API defaults, with a view to introducing other "sane" default API values in future releases.
>
> üìñ Read [Issuance behavior: Rotation of the private key](../../usage/certificate.md#issuance-behavior-rotation-of-the-private-key) to learn more about private key rotation in cert-manager.


### The default value of `Certificate.Spec.RevisionHistoryLimit` is now `1`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Potentially breaking change

The default value for the `Certificate` resource's `revisionHistoryLimit` field is now set to 1.
This ensures that old `CertificateRequest` revisions are automatically garbage collected, improving resource management and reducing clutter in clusters.
Previously, if not specified, no limit was applied, potentially leading to an accumulation of stale `CertificateRequest` resources.
With this update, users no longer need to manually configure the revision history limit to benefit from automated cleanup.

When you upgrade to cert-manager 1.18, all stale `CertificateRequest` resources will be garbage collected, unless you explicitly set the `revisionHistoryLimit` value on your `Certificate` resources.

### Copy annotations from Ingress or Gateway to the Certificate

We've added a new configuration option to the cert-manager controller: `--extra-certificate-annotations`, which allows you to specify annotation keys to be copied from an Ingress or Gateway resource to the resulting Certificate object.
Read [Annotated Ingress resource: Copy annotations to the Certificate](../../usage/ingress.md#copy-annotations-to-the-certificate ), and
[Annotated Gateway resource: Copy annotations to the Certificate](../../usage/gateway.md#copy-annotations-to-the-certificate), to learn more.

{/* BEGIN changelog v1.18.2 */}
## `v1.18.2`

We fixed a bug in the CSR's name constraints construction (only applies if you have enabled the `NameConstraints` feature gate).
We dropped the new `global.rbac.disableHTTPChallengesRole` Helm option due to a bug we found, this feature will be released in `v1.19` instead.

Changes since `v1.18.1`:

### Bug or Regression

- BUGFIX: permitted URI domains were incorrectly used to set the excluded URI domains in the CSR's name constraints ([`#7833`][#7833])
- Reverted adding the `global.rbac.disableHTTPChallengesRole` Helm option. ([`#7837`][#7837])

{/* END changelog v1.18.2 */}
{/* BEGIN changelog v1.18.1 */}
## `v1.18.1`

We have added a new feature gate `ACMEHTTP01IngressPathTypeExact`, to allow
`ingress-nginx` users to turn off the new default Ingress `PathType: Exact`
behavior, in ACME HTTP01 Ingress challenge solvers.

We have increased the ACME challenge authorization timeout to two minutes, which we hope will fix a timeout error (`error waiting for authorization`), which has been reported by multiple users, since the release of cert-manager `v1.16.0`.
This change should fix the following issues: [`#7337`][#7337], [`#7444`][#7444], and [`#7685`][#7685].
