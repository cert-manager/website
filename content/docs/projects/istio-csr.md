istio-csr is an agent that allows for [Istio](https://istio.io) workload and
control plane components to be secured using
[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io).

Certificates facilitating mTLS — both inter
and intra-cluster — will be signed, delivered and renewed using [cert-manager
issuers](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer).
