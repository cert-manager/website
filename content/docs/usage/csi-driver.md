description: 'Mounting cert-manager certificates without secrets'
---

csi-driver is a [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/) driver plugin for Kubernetes
which works alongside cert-manager.

Pods which mount the cert-manager csi-driver will request certificates from cert-manager
without needing a `Certificate` resource to be created. These certificates will be mounted
directly into the pod, with no intermediate Secret being created.

## Why use csi-driver?

- Ensure private keys never leave the node and are never sent over the network. Private keys are stored in memory, and shouldn't be written to disk.
- Unique key and certificate per application replica
- Fewer `Certificate` resources means writing less YAML
- Keys and certificates are destroyed when an application terminates
- No `Secret` resources needed for storing the certificate means less RBAC
- Great for ephemeral, short-lived certificates which don't need to survive a restart (e.g. certificates for mTLS)

## Why _not_ use csi-driver?

- If you need certificates to be persisted through a node restart
- If you need the same certificate to be shared by multiple components

## Installation

You must have a working installation of cert-manager present on your cluster and be running at least Kubernetes `v1.16`.

Instructions on how to install cert-manager can be found [on this website](../installation/README.md).

To install csi-driver, use helm:

```terminal
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update
helm upgrade -i -n cert-manager cert-manager-csi-driver jetstack/cert-manager-csi-driver --wait
```

Or apply the static manifests to your cluster:

```terminal
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update
helm template jetstack/cert-manager-csi-driver | kubectl apply -n cert-manager -f -
```


You can verify the installation has completed correctly by checking the presence
of the CSIDriver resource as well as a CSINode resource present for each node,
referencing `csi.cert-manager.io`.

```terminal
$ kubectl get csidrivers
NAME                     CREATED AT
csi.cert-manager.io   2019-09-06T16:55:19Z

$ kubectl get csinodes -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
  kind: CSINode
  metadata:
    name: kind-control-plane
    ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: v1
      kind: Node
      name: kind-control-plane
...
  spec:
    drivers:
    - name: csi.cert-manager.io
      nodeID: kind-control-plane
      topologyKeys: null
...
```

## Requesting and Mounting Certificates

Requesting a certificate using csi-driver means mounting a volume, with some attributes
set to define exactly what you need to request.

The following example is a dummy app that mounts a key certificate pair to `/tls`, signed using
a cert-manager issuer called `ca-issuer` with a DNS name valid for `my-service.sandbox.svc.cluster.local`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-csi-app
  namespace: sandbox
  labels:
    app: my-csi-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-frontend
      image: busybox
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/tls"
        name: tls
      command: [ "sleep", "1000000" ]
  volumes:
    - name: tls
      csi:
        driver: csi.cert-manager.io
        volumeAttributes:
              csi.cert-manager.io/issuer-name: ca-issuer
              csi.cert-manager.io/dns-names: ${POD_NAME}.${POD_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local
```

Once created, the CSI driver will generate a private key locally (for the pod), request a
certificate from cert-manager based on the given attributes, and store the certificate ready for the pod to use.

The pod will remain in a pending state until issuance has been completed.

For more information on how to set up issuers for your cluster, refer to the cert-manager documentation
[here](../configuration/README.md).

**Note** it is not possible to use `SelfSigned` Issuers with csi-driver because `SelfSigned` issuers are a
special case.

## Supported Volume Attributes

The csi-driver driver aims to have complete feature parity with all possible
values available through the cert-manager API. It currently supports the following values:

| Attribute                               | Description                                                                                                                    | Default                              | Example                          |

### Variables

The following attributes support variables that are evaluated when a request is
made for the mounting Pod. These variables are useful for constructing requests
with SANs that contain values from the mounting Pod.

```text
csi.cert-manager.io/common-name
csi.cert-manager.io/dns-names
csi.cert-manager.io/uri-sans
```

Variables follow the [go `os.Expand`](https://pkg.go.dev/os#Expand) structure,
which is generally what you would expect on a UNIX shell. The CSI driver has
access to the following variables:

```text
${POD_NAME}
${POD_NAMESPACE}
${POD_UID}
${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}
```

#### Example Usage

```yaml
volumeAttributes:
  csi.cert-manager.io/issuer-name: ca-issuer
  csi.cert-manager.io/dns-names: "${POD_NAME}.${POD_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local"
  csi.cert-manager.io/uri-sans: "spiffe://cluster.local/ns/${POD_NAMESPACE}/pod/${POD_NAME}/${POD_UID}"
  csi.cert-manager.io/common-name: "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}.${POD_NAMESPACE}"
```

## Requesting Certificates using the mounting Pod's ServiceAccount

If the flag `--use-token-request` is enabled on the csi-driver DaemonSet, the
[CertificateRequest](../concepts/certificaterequest.md) resource will be created
by the mounting Pod's ServiceAccount. This can be paired with
[approver-policy](./approver-policy/README.md) to enable advanced policy control
on a per-ServiceAccount basis.

Ensure that you give permissions to Pod ServiceAccounts to create CertificateRequests
with this flag enabled, i.e:

```yaml
# WARNING: This RBAC will enable any identity in the cluster to create
# CertificateRequests and is dangerous to use in production. Instead, you should
# give permissions only to identities which need to be able to create certificates.
# This would be done via scoping the set of identities in the `ClusterRoleBinding` `subjects` stanza.
