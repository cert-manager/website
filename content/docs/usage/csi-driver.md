csi-driver is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver plugin for Kubernetes
to work along cert-manager. The goal for this plugin is to seamlessly request
and mount certificate key pairs to pods. This is useful for facilitating mTLS,
or otherwise securing connections of pods with guaranteed present certificates
whilst having all of the features that cert-manager provides.

## Why a CSI Driver?

- Ensure private keys never leave the node and are never sent over the network.
  All private keys are stored locally on the node.
- Unique key and certificate per application replica with a grantee to be
  present on application run time.
- Reduce resource management overhead by defining certificate request spec
  in-line of the Kubernetes Pod template.
- Automatic renewal of certificates based on expiry of each individual
  certificate.
- Keys and certificates are destroyed during application termination.
- Scope for extending plugin behavior with visibility on each replica's
  certificate request and termination.

## Requirements and Installation

This CSI driver plugin makes use of the 'CSI inline volume' feature - Alpha as
of `v1.15` and beta in `v1.16`. Kubernetes versions `v1.16` and higher require
no extra configuration however `v1.15` requires the following feature gate set:
```
--feature-gates=CSIInlineVolume=true
```

You must have a working installation of cert-manager present on the cluster.
Instructions on how to install cert-manager can be found
[on cert-manager.io](../installation/README.md).

To install the csi-driver, use helm install:

```terminal
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update
helm upgrade -i -n cert-manager cert-manager-csi-driver jetstack/cert-manager-csi-driver --wait
```

Or apply the static manifests to your cluster:

```terminal
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update
helm template jetstack/cert-manager-csi-driver | kubectl apply -n cert-manager -f -
```


You can verify the installation has completed correctly by checking the presence
of the CSIDriver resource as well as a CSINode resource present for each node,
referencing `csi.cert-manager.io`.

```
$ kubectl get csidrivers
NAME                     CREATED AT
csi.cert-manager.io   2019-09-06T16:55:19Z

$ kubectl get csinodes -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
  kind: CSINode
  metadata:
    name: kind-control-plane
    ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: v1
      kind: Node
      name: kind-control-plane
...
  spec:
    drivers:
    - name: csi.cert-manager.io
      nodeID: kind-control-plane
      topologyKeys: null
...
```

The CSI driver is now installed and is ready to be used for pods in the cluster.

## Requesting and Mounting Certificates

To request certificates from cert-manager, simply define a volume mount where
the key and certificate will be written to, along with a volume with attributes
that define the cert-manager request. The following is a dummy app that mounts a
key certificate pair to `/tls` and has been signed by the `ca-issuer` with a DNS
name valid for `my-service.sandbox.svc.cluster.local`.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-csi-app
  namespace: sandbox
  labels:
    app: my-csi-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-frontend
      image: busybox
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/tls"
        name: tls
      command: [ "sleep", "1000000" ]
  volumes:
    - name: tls
      csi:
        driver: csi.cert-manager.io
        volumeAttributes:
              csi.cert-manager.io/issuer-name: ca-issuer
              csi.cert-manager.io/dns-names: ${POD_NAME}.${POD_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local
```

Once created, the CSI driver will generate a private key locally, request a
certificate from cert-manager based on the given attributes, then store both
locally to be mounted to the pod. The pod will remain in a pending state until
this process has been completed.

For more information on how to set up issuers for your cluster, refer to the
cert-manager documentation
[here](../configuration/README.md). **Note** it is not
possible to use `SelfSigned` Issuers with the CSI Driver. In order for
cert-manager to self sign a certificate, it needs access to the secret
containing the private key that signed the certificate request to sign the end
certificate. This secret is not used and so not available in the CSI driver use
case.

## Supported Volume Attributes

The csi-driver driver aims to have complete feature parity with all possible
values available through the cert-manager API however currently supports the
following values;

### Variables

The following attributes support variables that are evaluated when a request is
made for the mounting Pod. These variables are useful for constructing requests
with SANs that contain values from the mounting Pod.

```
`csi.cert-manager.io/common-name`
`csi.cert-manager.io/dns-names`
`csi.cert-manager.io/uri-sans`
```

Variables follow the [go `os.Expand`](https://pkg.go.dev/os#Expand) structure,
which is generally what you would expect on a UNIX shell. The CSI driver has
access to the following variables:

```
${POD_NAME}
${POD_NAMESPACE}
${POD_UID}
${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}
```

#### Example Usage

```yaml
volumeAttributes:
  csi.cert-manager.io/issuer-name: ca-issuer
  csi.cert-manager.io/dns-names: "${POD_NAME}.${POD_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local"
  csi.cert-manager.io/uri-sans: "spiffe://cluster.local/ns/${POD_NAMESPACE}/pod/${POD_NAME}/${POD_UID}"
  csi.cert-manager.io/common-name: "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}.${POD_NAMESPACE}"
```

## Requesting Certificates using the mounting Pod's ServiceAccount

If the flag `--use-token-request` is enabled on the csi-driver DaemonSet, the
[CertificateRequest](../concepts/certificaterequest.md) resource will be created
by the mounting Pod's ServiceAccount. This can be pared with
[approver-policy](./approver-policy/README.md) to enable advanced policy on a per
ServiceAccount basis.

Ensure to give permissions to Pod ServiceAccounts to create CertificateRequests
with this flag enabled, i.e:

```yaml
# WARNING: This RBAC will enable any identiy in the cluster to create
# CertificateRequests. This may or may not be problimatic based on your security
# model. It is likely worth scoping the set of identities in the
# `ClusterRoleBinding` `subjects` stanza.
