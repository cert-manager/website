title: Supported Releases
description: cert-manager supported releases, supported Kubernetes versions and release timeline

/*
Inspired by https://istio.io/latest/about/supported-releases/
*/

This page lists the status, timeline and policy for currently supported
releases.

Each release is supported for a period of four months, and we aim to create a new
release every two months.

## Support policy

### What we mean by support

Our support window is four months for each release branch. In the below
diagram, `release-1.2` is an example of a release branch. The support
window corresponds to the two latest releases, given that we produce a new
final release every two months. We offer two types of support:

- [Technical support](#technical-support),
- [Security and bug fixes](#bug-fixes-support).

For example, imagining that the latest release is `v1.2.0`, you can expect
support for both `v1.2.0` and `v1.1.0`. Only the last patch release of each
branch is actually supported.

```diagram

<h3 id="technical-support">Technical support</h3>

Technical assistance is offered on a best-effort basis for supported
releases only. You can request support from the community on [Kubernetes
Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) (in the `#cert-manager` channel), using
[GitHub Discussions][discussions] or using the [cert-manager-dev][group]
Google group.

[group]: https://groups.google.com/g/cert-manager-dev

<h3 id="bug-fixes-support">Security and bug fixes</h3>

We back-port important bug fixes — including security fixes — to all
currently supported releases.

- [Security issues](#security-issues),
- [Critical bugs](#critical-bugs),
- [Long-standing bugs](#long-standing-bugs).

<h4 id="security-issues">Security issues</h4>

**Security issues** are fixed as soon as possible. They get back-ported to
the last two releases, and a new patch release is immediately created for
them.

<h4 id="critical-bugs">Critical bugs</h4>

**Critical bugs** include both regression bugs as well as upgrade bugs.

Regressions are functionalities that worked in a previous release but no longer
work. [#4142][], [#3393][] and [#2857][] are three examples of regressions.

Upgrade bugs are issues (often Helm-related) preventing users from
upgrading to currently supported releases from earlier releases of
cert-manager. [#3882][] and [#3644][] are examples of upgrade bugs.

Note that [intentional breaking changes](#breaking-changes) do not belong to
this category.

Fixes for critical bugs are (usually) immediately back-ported by creating a new
patch release for the two currently supported releases.

<h4 id="long-standing-bugs">Long-standing bugs</h4>

**Long-standing bug**: sometimes a bug exists for a long time, and may have
known workarounds. [#3444][] is an example of a long-standing bug.

Where we feel that back-porting would be difficult or might be a stability
risk to clusters running cert-manager, we'll make the fix in a major
release but avoid back-porting the fix.

<h4 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h4>

Breaking changes are changes that intentionally break the cert-manager
Kubernetes API or the command line flags. We avoid making breaking changes
where possible, and where they're required we'll give as much notice as
possible.

<h2 id="kubernetes-supported-versions">How we determine supported Kubernetes versions</h2>

The list of supported Kubernetes versions displayed in the [Supported
Releases](#supported-releases) section depends on what the cert-manager
maintainers think is reasonable to support and to test.

As of 6th January 2022, our testing coverage is:

\*Oldest release relevant to the next cert-manager release, as of 2022-01-06

\*\*We say that a Kubernetes offering is "old" when it is not supported upstream
as per the [Version Skew
Policy](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/) page.

/*

To be added when those become "old":

- OpenShift 4: 1.20 (4.7, EOL Jun 2022), 1.21 (4.8, EOL Nov 2022)

With regard to OpenShift Container Platform 3, cert-manager 1.2 is the last
release to support OpenShift 3.11 (Kubernetes 1.11). Although OpenShift 3.11 is
still supported by Red Hat until June 2022, keeping support for very old
versions of Kubernetes had become too much of a burden.

> version and its associated Kubernetes version:

## Terminology

The term "release" (or "minor release") refers to one minor version of
cert-manager. For example, 1.2 and 1.3 are two releases. Note that we do
not use the prefix `v` for releases (just "1.2"). This is because releases
are not used as git tags.

Patch releases use the `v` prefix (e.g., `v1.2.0`, `v1.3.1`...) since one
patch release = one git tag. The initial patch release is called "final
release":

| Type of release | Example of git tag | Corresponding release | Corresponding release branch\* |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Final release   | `v1.3.0`           | 1.3                   | `release-1.3`                  |
| Patch release   | `v1.3.1`           | 1.3                   | `release-1.3`                  |
| Pre-release     | `v1.4.0-alpha.0`   | N/A\*\*               | `release-1.4`                  |

\*For maintainers: each release has an associated long-lived branch that we
call the “release branch”. For example, `release-1.2` is the release branch
for release 1.2.

\*\*Pre-releases (e.g., `v1.3.0-alpha.0`) don't have a corresponding
release (e.g., 1.3) since a release only exists after a final release
(e.g., `v1.3.0`) has been created.

Our naming scheme mostly follows [Semantic Versioning
2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with `v` prepended to git tags and docker
images:

```plain
v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

where `<minor>` is increased for each release, and `<patch>` counts the
number of patches for the current `<minor>` release. A patch is usually a
small change relative to the `<minor>` release.
