title: cert-manager Signature Verification
description: 'cert-manager installation: Code signing'
---

To help prevent [supply chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack), some cert-manager release
artifacts are cryptographically signed so you can be sure that the version of cert-manager you're about to install
is actually built by and provided by the cert-manager maintainers.

This signing is vitally important if for any reason you need to use a mirrored version of cert-manager; it allows you
to confirm that the mirror hasn't tampered with the code you're about to install.

Signing keys required for verification are all available on this website, but the actual key that you need might depend
on the artifact you're trying to validate in the future. At the time of writing, all signing is done using the same underlying
key.

## Container Images / Cosign

For all cert-manager versions from `v1.8.0` and later, cert-manager container images are signed and verifiable using [`cosign`](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview).

The simplest way to verify signatures is to download the public key and then pass it to the cosign CLI directly:

```console
curl -sSOL https://cert-manager.io/public-keys/cert-manager-pubkey-2021-09-20.pem
IMAGE_TAG=v1.8.0  # change as needed
cosign verify --signature-digest-algorithm sha512 --key cert-manager-pubkey-2021-09-20.pem quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-acmesolver:$IMAGE_TAG
cosign verify --signature-digest-algorithm sha512 --key cert-manager-pubkey-2021-09-20.pem quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-cainjector:$IMAGE_TAG
cosign verify --signature-digest-algorithm sha512 --key cert-manager-pubkey-2021-09-20.pem quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-ctl:$IMAGE_TAG
cosign verify --signature-digest-algorithm sha512 --key cert-manager-pubkey-2021-09-20.pem quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-controller:$IMAGE_TAG
cosign verify --signature-digest-algorithm sha512 --key cert-manager-pubkey-2021-09-20.pem quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-webhook:$IMAGE_TAG
```

## Helm Charts

<div className="alert">
Helm requires the use of PGP for verification; the key format is different.

Trying to use "plain" PEM encoded public keys during verification will fail.
</div>

For all cert-manager versions from `v1.6.0` and later, Helm charts are signed and verifiable through the Helm CLI.

The easiest way to verify is to grab the GPG keyring directly, which can then be passed into `helm verify` like so:

```console
curl -sSL https://cert-manager.io/public-keys/cert-manager-keyring-2021-09-20-1020CF3C033D4F35BAE1C19E1226061C665DF13E.gpg > cert-manager-keyring-2021-09-20-1020CF3C033D4F35BAE1C19E1226061C665DF13E.gpg
helm verify --keyring cert-manager-keyring-2021-09-20-1020CF3C033D4F35BAE1C19E1226061C665DF13E.gpg /path/to/cert-manager-vx.y.z.tgz
```

- GPG keyring: [`cert-manager-keyring-2021-09-20-1020CF3C033D4F35BAE1C19E1226061C665DF13E.gpg`](../../../public-keys/cert-manager-keyring-2021-09-20-1020CF3C033D4F35BAE1C19E1226061C665DF13E.gpg)

If you know what you're doing and you want the signing key in a format that's easy to import into GPG,
it's available in an ASCII armored version:

- ASCII-armored signing key: [`cert-manager-pgp-2021-09-20-1020CF3C033D4F35BAE1C19E1226061C665DF13E.asc`](../../../public-keys/cert-manager-pgp-2021-09-20-1020CF3C033D4F35BAE1C19E1226061C665DF13E.asc)
