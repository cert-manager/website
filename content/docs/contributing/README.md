## Welcome

Hello new or existing contributor!
Welcome to our contributors documentation, this is the place where we document all our processes
as well as how to compile, run and test cert-manager and all it's components.
This document sometimes can get out of date due to changes in the code and/or tooling. PRs to this part are
also very welcome if you happen to find an out of date part.
