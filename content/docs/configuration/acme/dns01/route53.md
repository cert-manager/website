description: 'cert-manager configuration: ACME DNS-01 challenges using Amazon AWS Route53 DNS'
---

This guide explains how to set up an `Issuer`, or `ClusterIssuer`, to use Amazon
Route53 to solve DNS01 ACME challenges. It's advised you read the [DNS01
Challenge Provider](./README.md) page first for a more general understanding of
how cert-manager handles DNS01 challenges.

> Note: This guide assumes that your cluster is hosted on Amazon Web Services
> (AWS) and that you already have a hosted zone in Route53.

## Set up an IAM Role

cert-manager needs to be able to add records to Route53 in order to solve the
DNS01 challenge. To enable this, create a IAM policy with the following
permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "route53:GetChange",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::change/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets",
        "route53:ListResourceRecordSets"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "route53:ListHostedZonesByName",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

> Note: The `route53:ListHostedZonesByName` statement can be removed if you
> specify the (optional) `hostedZoneID`. You can further tighten the policy by
> limiting the hosted zone that cert-manager has access to (e.g.
> `arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/DIKER8JEXAMPLE`).

## Credentials

You have two options for the set up - either create a user or a role and attach
that policy from above.  Using a role is considered best practice because you do
not have to store permanent credentials in a secret.

cert-manager supports two ways of specifying credentials:

- explicit by providing an `accessKeyID` or an `accessKeyIDSecretRef`, and a `secretAccessKeySecretRef`
- or implicit (using [metadata
  service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)
  or [environment variables or credentials
  file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials).

cert-manager also supports specifying a `role` to enable cross-account access
and/or limit the access of cert-manager. Integration with
[`kiam`](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam) and
[`kube2iam`](https://github.com/jtblin/kube2iam) should work out of the box.


## Cross Account Access

Example: Account Y manages Route53 DNS Zones. Now you want cert-manager running in Account X (or many other accounts) to be able to manage records in Route53 zones hosted in Account Y.

First, create a role with the permissions policy above (let's call the role `dns-manager`)
in Account Y, and attach a trust relationship like the one below.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXX:role/cert-manager"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

Bear in mind, that you won't be able to define this policy until `cert-manager` role on account Y is created. If you are setting this up using a configuration language, you may want to define principal as:

```json
"Principal": {
        "AWS": "XXXXXXXXXXX"
      }
```
And restrict it, in a future step, after all the roles are created.

This allows the role `cert-manager` in Account X to assume the `dns-manager` role in Account Y to manage the Route53 DNS zones in Account Y. For more information visit the [official
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html).

Second, create the cert-manager role in Account X; this will be used as a credentials source for the cert-manager pods running in Account X. Attach to the role the following **permissions** policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::YYYYYYYYYYYY:role/dns-manager",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

And the following trust relationship (Add AWS `Service`s as needed):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Creating an Issuer (or `ClusterIssuer`)

Here is an example configuration for a `ClusterIssuer`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    ...
    solvers:

    # example: cross-account zone management for example.com
    # this solver uses ambient credentials (i.e. inferred from the environment or EC2 Metadata Service)
    # to assume a role in a different account
    - selector:
        dnsZones:
          - "example.com"
      dns01:
        route53:
          region: us-east-1
          hostedZoneID: DIKER8JEXAMPLE # optional, see policy above

    # this solver handles example.org challenges
    # and uses explicit credentials
    - selector:
        dnsZones:
          - "example.org"
      dns01:
        route53:
          region: eu-central-1
          # The AWS access key ID can be specified using the literal accessKeyID parameter
          # or retrieved from a secret using the accessKeyIDSecretRef
          # If using accessKeyID, omit the accessKeyIDSecretRef parameter and vice-versa
          accessKeyID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
          accessKeyIDSecretRef:
            name: prod-route53-credentials-secret
            key: access-key-id
          secretAccessKeySecretRef:
            name: prod-route53-credentials-secret
            key: secret-access-key
          # you can also assume a role with these credentials
          role: arn:aws:iam::YYYYYYYYYYYY:role/dns-manager
```

Note that, as mentioned above, the pod is using `arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXX:role/cert-manager` as a credentials source in Account X, but the `ClusterIssuer` ultimately assumes the `arn:aws:iam::YYYYYYYYYYYY:role/dns-manager` role to actually make changes in Route53 zones located in Account Y.

## EKS IAM Role for Service Accounts (IRSA)

While [`kiam`](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam) / [`kube2iam`](https://github.com/jtblin/kube2iam) work directly with cert-manager, some special attention is needed for using the [IAM Roles for Service Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) feature available on EKS.

This feature uses Kubernetes `ServiceAccount` tokens to authenticate with AWS using the [API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html). 

> **Note**: For using IRSA with cert-manager you must first enable the feature for your cluster. You can do this by
> following the [official documentation(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).

Because `ServiceAccount` tokens are used to authenticate there are two modes of operation, you can either use cert-manager's own `ServiceAccount` to authenticate or you can reference your own `ServiceAccount` within your `Issuer`/`ClusterIssuer` config. Each option is described below.

### Using the cert-manager ServiceAccount

In this configuration an IAM role is mapped to the cert-manager `ServiceAccount` allowing it to authenticate with AWS. The IAM role you map to the `ServiceAccount` will need permissions on any and all Route53 zones cert-manager will be using.

#### IAM role trust policy

The cert-manager role needs the following trust relationship attached to the role in order to use the IRSA method. Replace the following:

- `<aws-account-id>` with the AWS account ID of the EKS cluster.
- `<aws-region>` with the region where the EKS cluster is located.
- `<eks-hash>` with the hash in the EKS API URL; this will be a random 32 character hex string (example: `45DABD88EEE3A227AF0FA468BE4EF0B5`)
- `<namespace>` with the namespace where cert-manager is running.
- `<service-account-name>` with the name of the `ServiceAccount` object created by cert-manager.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-id>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/id/<eks-hash>"
      },
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "oidc.eks.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/id/<eks-hash>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<service-account-name>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** If you're following the Cross Account example above, this trust policy is attached to the cert-manager role in Account X with ARN `arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXX:role/cert-manager`. The permissions policy is the same as above.

#### Service annotation

Annotate the `ServiceAccount` created by cert-manager:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXX:role/cert-manager
```

You will also need to modify the cert-manager `Deployment` with the correct file system permissions, so the `ServiceAccount` token can be read.

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 1001
```

The cert-manager Helm chart provides a variable for injecting annotations into cert-manager's `ServiceAccount` and `Deployment` object like so:

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXX:role/cert-manager
securityContext:
  fsGroup: 1001
```

**Note:** If you're following the Cross Account example above, modify the `ClusterIssuer` in the same way as above with the role from Account Y.

### Referencing your own ServiceAccount within Issuer/ClusterIssuer config 

In this configuration you can reference your own `ServiceAccounts` within your `Issuer`/`ClusterIssuer` and cert-manager will issue itself temporary credentials using these `ServiceAccounts`. Because each issuer can reference a different `ServiceAccount` you can lock down permissions much more, with each `ServiceAccount` mapped to an IAM role that only has permission on the zones it needs for that particular issuer.


#### Creating a ServiceAccount

In order to reference a `ServiceAccount` it must first exist. Unlike normal IRSA the `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation is not required, however you may wish to set it as a reference.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: <service-account-name>
  annotation:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: <iam-role-arn>
```

#### IAM role trust policy

For every `ServiceAccount` you want to use for AWS authentication you must first set up a trust policy. Replace the following:

- `<aws-account-id>` with the AWS account ID of the EKS cluster.
- `<aws-region>` with the region where the EKS cluster is located.
- `<eks-hash>` with the hash in the EKS API URL; this will be a random 32 character hex string (example: `45DABD88EEE3A227AF0FA468BE4EF0B5`)
- `<namespace>` with the namespace of the `ServiceAccount` object.
- `<service-account-name>` with the name of the `ServiceAccount` object.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-id>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/id/<eks-hash>"
      },
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "oidc.eks.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/id/<eks-hash>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<service-account-name>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** If you're following the Cross Account example above, this trust policy is attached to the cert-manager role in Account X with ARN `arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXX:role/cert-manager`. The permissions policy is the same as above.

#### RBAC

In order to allow cert-manager to issue a token using your `ServiceAccount` you must deploy some RBAC to the cluster. Replace the following:

- `<service-account-name>` name of the `ServiceAccount` object.
- `<service-account-namespace>` namespace of the `ServiceAccount` object.
- `<cert-manager-service-account-name>` name of cert-managers `ServiceAccount` object, as created during cert-manager installation.
- `<cert-manager-namespace>` namespace that cert-manager is deployed into.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: <service-account-name>-tokenrequest
  namespace: <service-account-namespace>
rules:
  - apiGroups: ['']
    resources: ['serviceaccounts/token']
    resourceNames: ['<service-account-name>']
    verbs: ['create']
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cert-manager-<service-account-name>-tokenrequest
  namespace: <service-account-namespace>
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: <cert-manager-service-account-name>
    namespace: <cert-manager-namespace>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: <service-account-name>-tokenrequest
```

#### Issuer/ClusterIssuer config

Once you have completed the above you should have:
- An IAM role with permissions required to on the Route53 zone.
- A Kubernetes `ServiceAccount`.
- A trust policy to allow the Kubernetes `ServiceAccount` access to your IAM role.
- RBAC to allow cert-manager to issue a token using the Kubernetes `ServiceAccount`.

You should be ready at this point to configure an Issuer to use the new `ServiceAccount`. You can see example config for this below:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  acme:
    ...
    solvers:
    - selector:
        dnsZones:
          - "example.com"
      dns01:
        route53:
          region: us-east-1
          role: <iam-role-arn> # This must be set so cert-manager what role to attempt to authenticate with
          auth:
            kubernetes:
              serviceAccountRef: 
                name: <service-account-name> # The name of the service account created
```
