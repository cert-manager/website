Below you will find details on various compatibility issues and quirks that you
may be effected by in your environment.

## GKE

When Google configure the control plane for private clusters, they automatically
configure VPC peering between your Kubernetes cluster's network and a separate
Google managed project.

In order to restrict what Google are able to access within your cluster, the
firewall rules configured restrict access to your Kubernetes pods. This will
mean that you will experience the webhook to not work and experience errors such
as `Internal error occurred: failed calling admission webhook ... the server is
currently unable to handle the request`.

In order to use the webhook component with a GKE private cluster, you must
configure an additional firewall rule to allow the GKE control plane access to
your webhook pod.

You can read more information on how to add firewall rules for the GKE control
plane nodes in the [GKE
docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#add_firewall_rules).

Alternatively, you can read how to [disable the webhook
component](#disabling-webhook).

## Disabling Webhook

If you are having issues with the webhook and cannot use it at this time, you
can optionally disable the webhook altogether.

Doing this may expose your cluster to miss-configuration problems that in some
cases could cause cert-manager to stop working altogether (i.e. if invalid types
are set for fields on cert-manager resources).

How you disable the webhook depends on your deployment method.

### With Helm

The Helm chart exposes an option that can be used to disable the webhook.

To do so with an existing installation, you can run:

```bash
$ helm upgrade cert-manager \
     --reuse-values \
     --set webhook.enabled=false
```

If you have not installed cert-manager yet, you can add the `--set
webhook.enabled=false` to the `helm install` command used to install
cert-manager.

### With static manifests

Because we cannot specify options when installing the static manifests to
conditionally disable different components, we also ship a copy of the
deployment files that do not include the webhook.

Instead of installing with
[`cert-manager.yaml`](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.13.1/cert-manager.yaml)
file, you should instead use the
[`cert-manager-no-webhook.yaml`](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.13.1/cert-manager-no-webhook.yaml)
file located in the deploy directory.

This is a destructive operation, as it will remove the
`CustomResourceDefinition` resources, causing your configured `Issuers`,
`Certificates` etc to be deleted.

You should first [backup your configuration](../tutorials/backup.md) before
running the following commands.

To re-install cert-manager without the webhook, run:

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.13.1/cert-manager.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.13.1/cert-manager-no-webhook.yaml
```

Once you have re-installed cert-manager, you should then [restore your
configuration](../tutorials/backup.md).
