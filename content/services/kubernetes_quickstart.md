Want to get a Kubernetes cluster up and running within a week? Kubernetes Quickstart is designed for companies with a working knowledge of container technology who want help to build and run their applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

The Jetstack team will get you from Zero to Kubernetes, without the pitfalls and without any wasted time. The cluster will be built to best-practice, and will provide an excellent foundation on which to work from. Your team will gain important skills, and get an introduction on how to run the cluster with an introductory workshop.
