There’s no generic slideware here, these are hands-on modular courses that will train you how to deploy Kubernetes, how to get it into production, and how to operate and manage it efficiently and effectively.

Jetstack’s training courses draw from their learning when deploying Kubernetes for their clients, and we focus heavily on proper knowledge transfer. Make your team stronger with Jetstack training.
