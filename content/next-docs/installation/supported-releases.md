{/*

This page lists the status, timeline and policy for currently supported releases.

Each release is supported for a period of four months, and we aim to create a new
release every two months.

<h2 id="supported-releases">Currently supported releases</h2>

| Release | Release Date |  End of Life | [Supported Kubernetes versions][s] | [Supported OpenShift versions][s] |
|---------|:------------:|:------------:|:----------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| [1.8][] | Apr 05, 2022 | Sep 07, 2022 |             1.19 → 1.24            |             4.6 → 4.11            |

## Upcoming releases

| Release | Release Date | End of life  | [Supported Kubernetes versions][s] | [Supported OpenShift versions][s] |
|---------|:------------:|:------------:|:----------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| [1.9][] | Jul 06, 2022 | Nov 09, 2022 |             1.20 → 1.24            |             4.7 → 4.11            |

Note that 1.9 was delayed by roughly a month because of KubeCon in May.

Dates in the future are uncertain and might change.

## Support policy

### What we mean by support

Our support window is four months for each release branch. In the below
diagram, `release-1.2` is an example of a release branch. The support
window corresponds to the two latest releases, given that we produce a new
final release every two months. We offer two types of support:

- [Technical support](#technical-support),
- [Security and bug fixes](#bug-fixes-support).

For example, imagining that the latest release is `v1.2.0`, you can expect
support for both `v1.2.0` and `v1.1.0`. Only the last patch release of each
branch is actually supported.

```diagram

<h3 id="technical-support">Technical support</h3>

Technical assistance is offered on a best-effort basis for supported
releases only. You can request support from the community on [Kubernetes
Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) (in the `#cert-manager` channel), using
[GitHub Discussions][discussions] or using the [cert-manager-dev][group]
Google group.

[discussions]: https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/discussions
[group]: https://groups.google.com/g/cert-manager-dev

<h3 id="bug-fixes-support">Security and bug fixes</h3>

We back-port important bug fixes — including security fixes — to all
currently supported releases.

- [Security issues](#security-issues),
- [Critical bugs](#critical-bugs),
- [Long-standing bugs](#long-standing-bugs).

<h4 id="security-issues">Security issues</h4>

**Security issues** are fixed as soon as possible. They get back-ported to
the last two releases, and a new patch release is immediately created for them.

<h4 id="critical-bugs">Critical bugs</h4>

**Critical bugs** include both regression bugs as well as upgrade bugs.

Regressions are functionalities that worked in a previous release but no longer
work. [#4142][], [#3393][] and [#2857][] are three examples of regressions.

Upgrade bugs are issues (often Helm-related) preventing users from
upgrading to currently supported releases from earlier releases of
cert-manager. [#3882][] and [#3644][] are examples of upgrade bugs.

Note that [intentional breaking changes](#breaking-changes) do not belong to
this category.

Fixes for critical bugs are (usually) immediately back-ported by creating a new
patch release for the currently supported releases.

<h4 id="long-standing-bugs">Long-standing bugs</h4>

**Long-standing bug**: sometimes a bug exists for a long time, and may have
known workarounds. [#3444][] is an example of a long-standing bug.

Where we feel that back-porting would be difficult or might be a stability
risk to clusters running cert-manager, we'll make the fix in a major
release but avoid back-porting the fix.

<h4 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h4>

Breaking changes are changes that intentionally break the cert-manager
Kubernetes API or the command line flags. We avoid making breaking changes
where possible, and where they're required we'll give as much notice as
possible.

<h4 id="other-backports">Other back-ports</h4>

We aim to be conservative in what we back-port. That applies especially for anything which
could be a _runtime_ change - that is, a change which might alter behavior for someone
upgrading between patch releases.

That means that if a candidate for back-porting has a chance of having a runtime impact we're
unlikely to accept the change unless it addresses a security issue or a critical bug.

We reserve the right to back-port other changes which are unlikely to have a runtime impact, such as
documentation or tooling changes. An example would be [#5209][] which updated how we perform a release of
cert-manager but didn't have any realistic chance of having a runtime impact.

Generally we'll seek to be pragmatic. A rule of thumb might be to ask:

"Does this back-port improve cert-manager, bearing in mind that we really value stability for already-released versions?"

<h2 id="kubernetes-supported-versions">How we determine supported Kubernetes versions</h2>

The list of supported Kubernetes versions displayed in the [Supported Releases](#supported-releases) section
depends on what the cert-manager maintainers think is reasonable to support and to test.

In practice, this is largely determined based on what versions of [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)
are available for testing.

As of 2022-04-06, our testing coverage is:

| Release branch |      Prow configuration       |         Dashboard         | Kubernetes versions tested |  Periodicity  |

### OpenShift

cert-manager supports several versions of OpenShift 4, based on the versions of Kubernetes
that each version maps to. For convenience, the following table shows these version mappings:

| OpenShift versions | Kubernetes version |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| 4.11               | 1.24               |
| 4.10, 4.10 EUS     | 1.23               |
| 4.9                | 1.22               |
| 4.8, 4.8 EUS       | 1.21               |
| 4.7                | 1.20               |
| 4.6, 4.6 EUS       | 1.19               |

The last version of cert-manager to support OpenShift 3 was cert-manager 1.2, which is
no longer maintained.

## Terminology

The term "release" (or "minor release") refers to one minor version of
cert-manager. For example, 1.2 and 1.3 are two releases. Note that we do
not use the prefix `v` for releases (just "1.2"). This is because releases
are not used as git tags.

Patch releases use the `v` prefix (e.g., `v1.2.0`, `v1.3.1`...) since one
patch release = one git tag. The initial patch release is called "final
release":

| Type of release | Example of git tag | Corresponding release | Corresponding release branch\* |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Final release   | `v1.3.0`           | 1.3                   | `release-1.3`                  |
| Patch release   | `v1.3.1`           | 1.3                   | `release-1.3`                  |
| Pre-release     | `v1.4.0-alpha.0`   | N/A\*\*               | `release-1.4`                  |

\*For maintainers: each release has an associated long-lived branch that we
call the “release branch”. For example, `release-1.2` is the release branch
for release 1.2.

\*\*Pre-releases (e.g., `v1.3.0-alpha.0`) don't have a corresponding
release (e.g., 1.3) since a release only exists after a final release
(e.g., `v1.3.0`) has been created.

Our naming scheme mostly follows [Semantic Versioning
2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with `v` prepended to git tags and docker
images:

```plain
v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

where `<minor>` is increased for each release, and `<patch>` counts the
number of patches for the current `<minor>` release. A patch is usually a
small change relative to the `<minor>` release.
