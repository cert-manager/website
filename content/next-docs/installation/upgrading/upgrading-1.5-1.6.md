### Upgrading cert-manager CRDs and stored versions of cert-manager custom resources

Following their deprecation in version 1.4, the cert-manager API versions `v1alpha2, v1alpha3, and v1beta1` are no longer served.

This means if your deployment manifests contain any of these API versions, you will not be able to deploy them after upgrading.
Our new `cmctl` utility or old `kubectl cert-manager` plugin can [convert](../../usage/cmctl.md#convert) old manifests to `v1` for you.

<div className="warning">

⛔️  If you are upgrading cert-manager on a cluster which has previously had
cert-manager < `v1.0.0`, you will need to ensure that all cert-manager custom
resources are stored in `etcd` at `v1` version and that cert-manger CRDs do not
reference the deprecated APIs **before you upgrade to `v1.6`**.

This is explained in more detail in the [Upgrading existing cert-manager resources](./remove-deprecated-apis.md#upgrading-existing-cert-manager-resources)
page.

If you are currently using HTTP-01 challenges or the Ingress shim annotations, please read the [Ingress class compatibility](./ingress-class-compatibility.md)
notes to see if your Ingress controller has any known issues with the migration to Ingress v1.

## Now Follow the Regular Upgrade Process

From here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](./README.md).
