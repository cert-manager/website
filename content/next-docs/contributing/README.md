## Great to See You!

Whether you're a previous contributor or a first timer looking to get involved, we love
it when the community comes together to improve the project!

In this "contributing" section we document processes we follow as a project, and include
some details on how to build, test and run cert-manager for development purposes.

## Meetings

All cert-manager meetings are open for everyone to join!
