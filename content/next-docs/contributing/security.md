title: Reporting Security Issues
description: 'cert-manager contributing: Security policy'

Security is the number one priority for cert-manager. If you think you've
found a vulnerability in any cert-manager project, please follow the
[vulnerability reporting process](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
documented in the main cert-manager repository.

The reporting process is the same for all repositories under the
cert-manager organization. The process is documented in one place to ensure
a single source of truth and a single list of [security contacts](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/blob/master/SECURITY_CONTACTS.md).
