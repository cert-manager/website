## 'Breakfast Briefing' with Jetstack and Google

The first 'Breakfast Briefing' hosted by Jetstack is here! For this event we're excited to have our speakers share some of their experiences in the delivery of hybrid cloud solutions, particularly in migrating and modernising corporate and enterprise [level] workloads with Anthos.

## Migrating and Modernising Workloads with Anthos

[Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/) is an open hybrid and multi-cloud application platform facilitates the modernisation of existing applications, along with the means to and run them anywhere in a secure manner. Built on open source technologies pioneered by Google—including Kubernetes, Istio, and Knative—Anthos enables consistency between on-premises and cloud environments and helps accelerate application development.

We understand there's rapidly changing market demands resulting in more requirements and expectations placed on corporations and enterprises today.

Consequently, more enterprises are looking to leverage the capabilities of public clouds by migrating from an on-premises environments, yielding many strategic  regarding vendors and technologies, but also how to provision and manage resources, and deploy applications.

Using our collective experience in delivering hybrid cloud solutions, we will discuss microservice migration paths and practices to deliver successful hybrid scenarios for enterprise workloads.
