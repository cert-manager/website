Using the experience accrued in delivering hybrid cloud solutions, we will
discuss the migration paths and architectures used in practice to deliver
successful hybrid scenarios for enterprise workloads.

The need to adapt rapidly to changing market demands has caused a rise in the
requirements and expectations placed on enterprises. Many companies find it
challenging to accommodate and adapt to these trends by using existing compute
infrastructure and processes.

Consequently, more enterprises are looking to leverage the capabilities of
public clouds by migrating from an on-premises environments, yielding many
decisions and considerations. Not only must strategic decisions be made
regarding vendors and technologies, but also how to provision and manage
resources, and deploy applications.

Leveraging hybrid cloud scenarios provides the ability to control the
distribution of compute across on-premises and cloud environments, as well as
instigating a cloud adoption model and accelerating the provisioning of compute
and storage resources. This facilitates enterprises to deploy their software to
the environment of their choosing to maximise the offering of such an
environment, and thus deliver the optimum business value.

## Kubernetes in Hybrid clouds

Whether it's running on-premises or in a cloud environment, Kubernetes provides
a consistent platform for running distributed workloads. Through either managed
services, licensed vendor offerings or self hosting, the platform will be
homogeneous such that workloads can be scheduled based on business decisions.

## Multi Mesh

Common abstractions atop of Kubernetes such as Istio are providing further
capabilities to secure, observe and manage our environments and workloads.
Coupled with hybrid solutions, multi-mesh architectures can enable communication
between federated meshes and organisational boundaries, further bridging the gap
between segregated clusters of compute.
