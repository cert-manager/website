## Automating X.509 Machine Identities in Kubernetes

Designed for security professionals and developers who want hands-on experience securing machine identities in Kubernetes using cert-manager. We'll help you identify the role and importance of machine identities (X.509 certificates) in your organizationâ€”especially if you are building new or next generation infrastructures using containers, micro-services and other modern deployment technologies. Then, we will discuss how you can help developers and InfoSec teams solve identity and secure communications challenges in a way that speeds up development while keeping modern applications secure.
