## Jetstack Connect

This is the second in a series of afternoons hosted by Jetstack, giving our customers and the wider community the opportunity to learn from each other. Each event focuses on Kubernetes and cloud native ecosystem trends and challenges, with a mixture of Jetstack speakers and special guests.

## Kubernetes in Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments

Leveraging hybrid cloud scenarios provides the ability to control the distribution of compute across on-premises and cloud environments, as well as instigating a cloud adoption model and accelerating the provisioning of compute and storage resources.

This facilitates enterprises to deploy their software to the environment of their choosing to maximise the offering of such an environment, and thus deliver the optimum business value.

Whether it's running on-premises or in a cloud environment, Kubernetes provides a consistent platform for running distributed workloads. Through either managed services, licensed vendor offerings or self hosting, the platform will be homogeneous such that workloads can be scheduled based on business decisions.

Common abstractions atop of Kubernetes such as Istio are providing further capabilities to secure, observe and manage our environments and workloads. Coupled with hybrid solutions, multi-mesh architectures can enable communication between federated meshes and organisational boundaries, further bridging the gap between segregated clusters of compute.
