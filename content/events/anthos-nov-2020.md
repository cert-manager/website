## Google Anthos

Google Anthos is a framework of software components, orientated around managing the deployment and life-cycling of infrastructure and workloads across multiple environments and locations. With enterprises having established infrastructure presences across multiple cloud providers and on-premises locations, Google Anthos centralises the orchestration of segregated clusters and workloads, providing a single-pane-of-glass across hybrid and multi-cloud topologies.

The value proposition of Google Anthos is to enable environmental agnosticism, with containers and Kubernetes being the common denominator for our workloads. This allows for a level of portability through Google Anthos to manage workload deployments and lifecycles across multi-cloud (GCP, AWS and Azure), as well as on-prem data centres (VMWare & bare metal).
At Jetstack, we're seeing an increasing amount of clients seeking to either adopt or mature their Kubernetes offering, whilst leveraging the advantages of cloud-native principles in accordance with their business requirements and existing infrastructure investments.

## Hybrid and multi-cloud environments

This webinar will introduce the context and motivations for Google Anthos and how it builds atop of technologies like Kubernetes and Istio to allow companies to modernise in place by laying the foundations to migrate and align workloads across organisational boundaries.
