Marshal is a Kubernetes-native Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS). It enables stateful services to be deployed as first-class citizens in Kubernetes, meaning a consistent deployment experience for stateless and stateful services alike.

Controllers manage the complexities of database-specific scale-up/down, maintenance and more. Current (alpha) support includes Elasticsearch and Couchbase.

The roadmap for Marshal in 2017 includes extending support to more databases and making Marshal services consumable via a Service Broker for true developer self-service.
