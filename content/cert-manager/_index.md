description: |
  cert-manager builds on top of Kubernetes, introducing certificate issuers and certificates as first-class resource types in the Kubernetes API. This makes it possible to provide 'Certificates as a Service' to developers working within your Kubernetes clusters.
about:
  title: About cert-manager
  body: cert-manager is the leading open source software for machine identity automation in cloud native environments. It makes it easy for developers to secure applications in Kubernetes and OpenShift platforms, automating X.509 certificate issuance and renewal from a certificate provider of choice.

automate:
  title: Automate Machine Identities in Kubernetes
  body: cert-manager handles the issuing and management of x.509 machine identities within Kubernetes clusters. cert-manager automates issuing certificates on demand using Kubernetes APIs, as well as renewing the certificates before they expire. cert-manager comes with support for commonly-used certificate issuers, and can be extended to support others as needed. cert-manager allows you to restrict who can use each issuer, allowing you to apply policy within your organization.

integrate:
  title: Integrations with popular Kubernetes extensions
  body: The certificates can be consumed in any way you want, and cert-manager comes with support for use with Kubernetes Ingress. Many other Kubernetes services integrate with cert-manager through its APIs, including service mesh, allowing them to seamlessly issue certificates that are compliant with your policies.
