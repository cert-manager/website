KubeCon EU London 2025 is now behind us and we had a great time meeting the community.

***Thank you to everyone who came by to meet the cert-manager team!***

## Recap

### How We Solved TLS at Scale: Self-Service, Multi-Tenant cert-manager

You can now watch [Tim & Erik's talk](https://youtu.be/gWgagjHtnlE?si=mqUCMwMc04tF5Jlt) at your convenience on YouTube.

For the last talk of the day at 17:30 London time, this was an extremely well attended talk!
Even better were the questions and interest from the audience at the end.

Congratulations Tim & Erik for a really well thought out and delivered talk.
This talk may inspire your own PKI management enhancements.

A big thank you to Ash for leading that part.
