card_description: >
  Introduces the concept of Kubernetes controllers, sometimes called operators, 
  and outlines best practices for extending the functionality of the API server

**Duration:** 1 day

## Participant level
This course is designed for people with experience both working with Kubernetes,
and developing applications in Go. To get the most out of the day participants
must bring their own laptop, with a development environment ready to use.

## Learning outcomes
#### Knowledge
In-depth understanding of the machinery of the Kubernetes API Server

What workloads and applications are suitable for being run and maintained using
operators

Best-practice controller design patterns (and anti-patterns to avoid) to ensure
that an operator is maintainable and upgradable

#### Skills
Extend the API server by defining new Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

Use Kubebuilder as an opinionated framework for building controllers

Participate in group design discussions
