**Duration:** 1 day

## Participant level
This course is for people with experience both working with Kubernetes,
and developing applications in Go.
To get the most out of the day participants must bring their own laptop,
with a development environment ready to use.

## Course content

Gain an understanding of the inner workings of the Kubernetes API server, which serves as the front end for the Kubernetes control plane. Later, attendees learn best practices for extending the functionality of the API server through defining new kinds using Custom Resource Definitions. Using Kubebuilder as a controller building framework, workshops instruct attendees to declare their own kind and build a corresponding controller. At the dayâ€™s conclusion, advanced controller techniques are covered with workshops and a group design discussions.
