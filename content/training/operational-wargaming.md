**Duration:** 1 or 2 days

## Participant level
This course is designed for those who operate a Kubernetes cluster as part of
their job. You should be familiar with the architecture of Kubernetes and its
components and have a good understanding of different resource types.

## Learning outcomes
Participants are divided into teams and provided with their own GKE cluster
running a “mission-critical” service.

Through a series of scenarios based on real-world issues tackled by Jetstack and
our customers, the "wheel of misfortune" is spun, and clusters are subjected to
changes affecting the availability of this service. Teams will battle it out to
see who can fix the issue fastest!

After each scenario, participants are presented with a detailed diagnosis of the
issue followed by a discussion around related concepts.
