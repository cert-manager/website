**Duration:** 1 day

## Participant level
This course is for those with some working experience of operating Kubernetes in
production. You should have an understanding of the Kubernetes components, as
well as cloud provider compute and networking. Some knowledge of Public Key
Infrastructure is also helpful, as is some distributed systems operational
experience.

## Course content
Participants will be taken step-by-step through how to provision a
highly-available and secure cluster from the ground-up with detailed
explanations of the available configuration parameters for each cluster
component and how they affect cluster behaviour. The day will finish with an
overview of how some cluster provisioners spin up clusters and how they compare
to the method chosen for the workshop.
