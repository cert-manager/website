card_description: >
  Participants are guided through deploying Istio and Knative to a Google 
  Kubernetes Engine cluster, followed by instructions on how to deploy an 
  application to the cluster using Knative services. The application is iterated
  upon and improved throughout the day, simulating a real-life development 
  lifecycle. Later, advanced deployment patterns using Knative and Istio traffic
  shaping are covered.

**Duration:** 1 day

## Participant level
Participants should have used Kubernetes and written some simple applications
and Dockerfiles manually or with some kind of service. To get the most out of
the day participants must bring their own laptop, with a development environment
ready to use.

## Learning outcomes
#### Knowledge
Understand the architectural overview of both Knative and Istio to gain an
understanding of the benefits that they provide to application developers

Security considerations when running an application using Knative

How to access service logs and metrics to perform diagnostics and debugging

#### Skills
Deploy and update an application using Knative

Auto-scale the application to allow the service to react intelligently to demand

Use Istio to configure traffic routing and perform advanced deployment and
rollout patterns
