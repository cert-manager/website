**Duration:** 1 day

## Participant level
Participants should be familiar with modern web applications and understand what
they need in production. They should have basic understanding of what Kubernetes
offers as a platform for web applications. They may have some experience with a
local Docker development environment for an application.

## Course content
In this workshop, we will demonstrate the features of Kubernetes that enable end
users - those who write and deploy applications to clusters - to move faster and
more safely. We will cover many of the technologies and patterns in use today,
empowering participants to make the right decisions their environment. There
will be hands-on workshops deploying applications to a GKE cluster to
demonstrate various features.
