card_description: >
  Explores the mechanisms offered by Kubernetes that allow application developers
  to iterate faster and more safely. Covers design patterns and deployment
  strategies that are in use today, and empowers participants to make the right
  design decisions to allow their applications to run effectively and reliably
  in Kubernetes.

**Duration:** 1 or 2 days

## Participant level
Participants should be familiar with modern web applications and understand how
to execute and test source code on their own machines.

They may have some experience with using Docker to provide a development
environment for this purpose, and have a basic understanding of what Kubernetes
offers as a platform for web applications.

## Learning outcomes
#### Day 1
#### Knowledge
The role of core Kubernetes resources (Pod / ReplicaSet / Deployment / Service /
Ingress)

Using Kubernetes to pass in configuration and secrets to running applications

How to use Kubernetes startup and shutdown features to ensure that apps are
initialised in a stable environment and are shut down gracefully

#### Skills
Configure your applications to adhere to the cloud-native 12-Factor methodology
Deploy simple applications to a GKE cluster and update them using various rollout
strategies

Configure application code to allow Kubernetes to understand how to effectively
scale, restart and roll out updates to an application

## -

#### Day 2
#### Knowledge
Security considerations in cloud-native apps and recommended tools to minimise
risk

Identify performance bottlenecks by using tracing to visualise requests from the
end user

Effective debugging strategies for identifying and fixing outages caused by
application bugs

#### Skills
Configure effective monitoring and logging of an application running on Kubernetes

Connect an application to caches and databases

Set up dev tools that tighten the feedback loop between application code and a
running Kubernetes environment

Package your Kubernetes services with their dependencies to allow code to be
shared with colleagues, tested and deployed dependably
