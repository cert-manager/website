# Deprecated Features and Breaking Changes

## Certificate renewal period calculation

There have been slight changes in the renewal period calculation for
certificates. Renewal time (`rt`) is now calculated using the following formula
(see [here](../../usage/certificate/#renewal) for the details):

```
rt = notAfter - rb
```

where `rb` is:

```
rb = min(renewBefore, cert duration / 3)
```

Before 1.4, `rt` was calculated using formula:

```
rt = notAfter - rb
```

where `rb` is:

```
if cert duration < renewBefore; then rb = cert duration
/ 3; else rb = renewBefore
```

This change fixes a bug where, if a certificate's duration is very slightly
larger than `renewBefore` period, then a cert gets renewed at `notAfter -
renewBefore` which can lead to a continuous renewal loop, see
[`cert-manager#3897`](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues/3897).

## Upgrading cert-manager CRDs and stored versions of cert-manager custom resources

We have deprecated the following cert-manager APIs:

- `cert-manager.io/v1alpha2`
- `cert-manager.io/v1alpha3`
- `cert-manager.io/v1beta1`
- `acme.cert-manager.io/v1alpha2`
- `acme.cert-manager.io/v1alpha3`
- `acme.cert-manager.io/v1beta1`

These APIs will be removed in cert-manager `v1.6.0`.
If you have a cert-manager installation that is using or has previously used these deprecated APIs you may need to upgrade your cert-manager custom resources and CRDs. This needs to be done before upgrading to cert-manager `v1.6.0`.
See cert-manager [docs](../../installation/upgrading/remove-deprecated-apis/#upgrading-existing-cert-manager-resources) for more detailed upgrade instructions.
