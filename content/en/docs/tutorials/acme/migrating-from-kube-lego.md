[kube-lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego) is an older Jetstack project
for obtaining TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt (or another ACME server).

Since cert-managers release, kube-lego has been gradually deprecated in favor
of this project. There are a number of key differences between the two:

| Feature                                   | kube-lego                        | cert-manager           |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Configuration                             | Annotations on Ingress resources | CRDs                   |
| CAs                                       | ACME                             | ACME, signing key pair |
| Kubernetes                                | `v1.2` - `v1.8`                  | `v1.7+`                |
| Debugging                                 | Look at logs                     | Kubernetes Events API  |
| Multi-tenancy                             | Not supported                    | Supported              |
| Distinct issuance sources per Certificate | Not supported                    | Supported              |
| Ingress controller support (ACME)         | GCE, NGINX                       | All                    |

This guide will walk through how you can safely migrate your kube-lego
installation to cert-manager, without service interruption.

By the end of the guide, we should have:

1. Scaled down and removed kube-lego

2. Installed cert-manager

3. Migrated ACME private key to cert-manager

4. Created an ACME `ClusterIssuer` using this private key, to issue certificates
   throughout your cluster

5. Configured cert-manager's [`ingress-shim`](../../../usage/ingress/) to
   automatically provision Certificate resources for all Ingress resources with
  the `kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"` annotation, using the `ClusterIssuer` we
  have created

6. Verified that the cert-manager installation is working


## 1. Scale down kube-lego

Before we begin deploying cert-manager, it is best we scale our kube-lego
deployment down to 0 replicas. This will prevent the two controllers
potentially 'fighting' each other. If you deployed kube-lego using the official
deployment YAMLs, a command like so should do:

```bash
$ kubectl scale deployment kube-lego \
    --namespace kube-lego \
    --replicas=0
```

You can then verify your kube-lego pod is no longer running with:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods --namespace kube-lego
```

## 2. Deploy cert-manager

cert-manager should be deployed using Helm, according to our official
[installation guide](../../../installation/). No special steps are
required here. We will return to this deployment at the end of this guide and
perform an upgrade of some of the CLI flags we deploy cert-manager with however.

Please take extra care to ensure you have configured RBAC correctly when
deploying Helm and cert-manager - there are some nuances described in our
deploying document!

## 3. Obtaining your ACME account private key

In order to continue issuing and renewing certificates on your behalf, we need
to migrate the user account private key that kube-lego has created for you over
to cert-manager.

Your ACME user account identity is a private key, stored in a secret resource.
By default, kube-lego will store this key in a secret named `kube-lego-account`
in the same namespace as your kube-lego Deployment. You may have overridden this
value when you deploy kube-lego, in which case the secret name to use will be
the value of the `LEGO_SECRET_NAME` environment variable.

You should download a copy of this secret resource and save it in your local
directory:

```bash
$ kubectl get secret kube-lego-account -o yaml \
    --namespace kube-lego \
    --export > kube-lego-account.yaml
```

Once saved, open up this file and change the `metadata.name` field to something
more relevant to cert-manager. For the rest of this guide, we'll assume you
chose `letsencrypt-private-key`.

Once done, we need to create this new resource in the `cert-manager` namespace.
By default, cert-manager stores supporting resources for `ClusterIssuers` in the
namespace that it is running in, and we used `cert-manager` when deploying
cert-manager above. You should change this if you have deployed cert-manager
into a different namespace.

```bash
$ kubectl create -f kube-lego-account.yaml \
    --namespace cert-manager
```

## 4. Creating an ACME `ClusterIssuer` using your old ACME account

We need to create a `ClusterIssuer` which will hold information about the ACME
account previously registered via kube-lego. In order to do so, we need two more
pieces of information from our old kube-lego deployment: the server URL of the
ACME server, and the email address used to register the account.

Both of these bits of information are stored within the kube-lego `ConfigMap`.

To retrieve them, you should be able to `get` the `ConfigMap` using `kubectl`:

```bash
$ kubectl get configmap kube-lego -o yaml \
    --namespace kube-lego \
    --export
```

Your email address should be shown under the `.data.lego.email` field, and the
ACME server URL under `.data.lego.url`.

For the purposes of this guide, we will assume the email is
`user@example.com` and the URL
`https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`.

Now that we have migrated our private key to the new Secret resource, as well as
obtaining our ACME email address and URL, we can create a `ClusterIssuer`
resource!

Create a file named `cluster-issuer.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  # Adjust the name here accordingly
  name: letsencrypt-staging
spec:
  acme:
    # The ACME server URL
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # Email address used for ACME registration
    email: user@example.com
    # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key from step 3
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-private-key
    # Enable the HTTP-01 challenge provider
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
```

We then submit this file to our Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
$ kubectl create -f cluster-issuer.yaml
```

You should be able to verify the ACME account has been verified successfully:

```bash
$ kubectl describe clusterissuer letsencrypt-staging
...
Status:
  Acme:
    Uri:  https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/7571319
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2019-01-30T14:52:03Z
    Message:               The ACME account was registered with the ACME server
    Reason:                ACMEAccountRegistered
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
```

## 5. Configuring ingress-shim to use our new `ClusterIssuer` by default

Now that our `ClusterIssuer` is ready to issue certificates, we have one last
thing to do: we must reconfigure `ingress-shim` (deployed as part of cert-manager)
to automatically create Certificate resources for all Ingress resources it finds
with appropriate annotations.

More information on the role of ingress-shim can be found [in the
docs](../../../usage/ingress/), but for now we can just run a `helm
upgrade` in order to add a few additional flags. Assuming you've named your
`ClusterIssuer` `letsencrypt-staging` (as above), run:

```bash
$ helm upgrade cert-manager \
     jetstack/cert-manager \
     --namespace cert-manager \
     --set ingressShim.defaultIssuerName=letsencrypt-staging \
     --set ingressShim.defaultIssuerKind=ClusterIssuer
```

You should see the cert-manager pod be re-created, and once started it should
automatically create Certificate resources for all of your ingresses that
previously had kube-lego enabled.

## 6. Verify each ingress now has a corresponding Certificate

Before we finish, we should make sure there is now a Certificate resource for
each ingress resource you previously enabled kube-lego on.

You should be able to check this by running:

```bash
$ kubectl get certificates --all-namespaces
```

There should be an entry for each ingress in your cluster with the kube-lego
annotation.

We can also verify that cert-manager has 'adopted' the old TLS certificates by
viewing the logs for cert-manager:

```bash
$ kubectl logs -n cert-manager -l app=cert-manager -c cert-manager
...
I1025 21:54:02.869269       1 sync.go:206] Certificate my-example-certificate scheduled for renewal in 292 hours
```

Here we can see cert-manager has verified the existing TLS certificate and
scheduled it to be renewed in 292 hours time.
