## Slack

We have two cert-manager channels on [the Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io) which we use to communicate:

* `cert-manager`: a general channel for all users of cert-manager; use this one for any usage related questions.
* `cert-manager-dev`: a channel for collaboration between cert-manager contributors and maintainers; please only use this for code related questions
