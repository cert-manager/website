This document aims to outline the process that should be followed for cutting a
new release of cert-manager.

## Prerequisites

First ensure that you have all the tools and permissions required to
perform a cert-manager release:

1. Install the [`release-notes`](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/cmd/release-notes/README.md) CLI:
   ```sh
   (cd && GO111MODULE=on go get k8s.io/release/cmd/release-notes@v0.7.0)
   ```
2. Install our [`cmrel`](https://github.com/cert-manager/release) CLI:
   ```sh
   (cd && GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/cert-manager/release/cmd/cmrel@latest)
   ```
3. Clone and `cd` into the `cert-manager/release` repo. ‚ö†Ô∏è All the commands
   below have to be run from this  cloned folder as it contains the
   necessary `cloudbuild.yml` files.

     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/cert-manager/release
     cd release
     ```

4. Make sure you are granted these roles on the GCP project [cert-manager-release](https://console.cloud.google.com/?project=cert-manager-release):
    - "Cloud Build Editor" (`roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder`),
    - "Storage Object Viewer" (`roles/storage.objectViewer`), and
    - "Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter" `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypter`.

    As a quick check, check that you can open [this Cloud
    Build](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build?project=cert-manager-release)
    page.
5. You must have time to complete all the steps in the release process (~1 hour).
6. Install the [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) CLI.
7. [Login](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#running_gcloud_auth_login)
   to `gcloud`:

   ```sh
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

8. Make sure `gcloud` points to the cert-manager-release project:

   ```sh
   gcloud config set project cert-manager-release
   ```

9.  Get a GitHub access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   with no scope ticked. It is used only by the `release-notes` CLI to
   avoid API rate limiting since it will go through all the PRs one by one.

## Minor releases

A minor release is a backwards-compatible 'feature' release.  It can contain new
features and bug fixes.

### Release schedule

We aim to cut a new minor release once per month. The rough goals for each
release are outlined as part of a GitHub milestone. We cut a release even if
some of these goals are missed, in order to keep up release velocity.

### Process for releasing a minor version

> Note: please click on the "Edit this page" button on the top-right corner
> of this page if a step is missing or if it is outdated.

The process for cutting a minor release is as follows:

1. Ensure upgrading document exists. See for example, see
   [upgrading-1.0-1.1](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/upgrading-1.0-1.1/)
   (not necessary for alpha and patch releases)

2. Create or update the release branch

    If this is the first alpha release (`alpha.0`), then you will need to create
    the release branch:

    ```bash
    git fetch --all
    git checkout -b release-1.0 origin/master
    ```

    If there has already been an alpha release, the release branch will
    already exist, so you will need to update it with the latest commits
    from the master branch, as follows:

    ```bash
    git fetch --all
    git branch --force release-1.0 origin/release-1.0
    git checkout release-1.0
    git merge --ff-only origin/master
    ```

3. Push it to the `jetstack/cert-manager` repository

     Note 1: run `git remote -v` to check that `origin` points to the
     upstream <https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager.git>.

     Note 2: you need to be an "admin" of the GitHub project to be able to
     push to the release branch.

     ```bash
     git push --set-upstream origin
     ```

4. Generate and edit the release notes:

   1. Run as follows, substituting the current and last versions where appropriate:

        ```bash
        export GITHUB_TOKEN=*your-token*
        export RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
        export BRANCH=release-1.0
        export END_REV=release-1.0
        export START_REV=v0.16.1
        (cd && GO111MODULE=on go get k8s.io/release/cmd/release-notes@v0.7.0)
        release-notes --debug --repo-path cert-manager \
          --org jetstack --repo cert-manager \
          --required-author "jetstack-bot" \
          --output release-notes.md
        ```

        Note: the GitHub token does not need any scope. The token is
        required only to avoid rate-limits imposed on anonymous API users.

   2. Sanity check the notes, checking that the notes contain details of all
      the features and bug fixes that you expect to be in the release. Add
      additional blurb, notable items and characterize change log.

        You can see the commits that will go into this release by using the
        [GitHub compare](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/compare). For
        example, while releasing `v1.0.0`, you want to compare it with the
        latest pre-released version `v1.0.0-beta.1`:

        <https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/compare/v1.0.0-beta.1...master>


5. Run `cmrel stage`

   1. In this example we stage a release using the 'release-1.0' branch,
      setting  the release version to `v1.0.0`:

        ```bash
        cmrel stage --branch=release-1.0 --release-version=v1.0.0
        ```

        This step takes ~10 minutes. It will build all Docker images and
        create all the manifest files and upload them to a storage bucket on
        Google Cloud. These artifacts will be published and released in the
        next steps.

        The final line of output contains URL of the bucket containing the
        release artifacts. The final segment in that URL contains the
        `RELEASE_NAME`, which you will need in the next step.

   2. While the build is running, send a first Slack message to
      `#cert-manager-dev`:

        _Releasing `1.2.0-alpha.2` üßµ_

        ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: please have a quick look at the build log as it might
        contain some unredacted data that we forgot to redact. We try to
        make sure the sensitive data is properly redacted but sometimes we
        forget to update this.

   3. Send a second Slack message in reply to this first message with the
      Cloud Build job link that `cmrel` displayed in "View logs at". For
      example, the message would look like:

        _Follow the cmrel stage build: <https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds/7641734d-fc3c-42e7-9e4c-85bfc4d1d547?project=1021342095237>_

6. Run `cmrel publish`

   1. First do a dry-run, to ensure that all the staged resources are valid.

        ```bash
        cmrel publish --release-name <RELEASE_NAME>
        ```

        Where `<RELEASE_NAME>` is the unique build ID printed by the earlier `cmrel stage` command.

        For example, given the bucket
        `gs://cert-manager-release/stage/gcb/release/v1.0.0-219b793`, the
        `RELEASE_NAME` would be `v1.0.0-219b793`.

        You can view the progress by clicking the Google Cloud Build URL in the output of this command.

   2. While the build is running, send a third Slack message in reply to
      the first message:

        _Follow the cmrel publish dry-run build: <https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds16f6f875-0a23-4fff-b24d-3de0af207463?project=1021342095237>_

   3. Next publish the release artifacts for real.

        If the last step succeeded, you can now re-run the `cmrel publish`
        with the `--nomock` argument to actually publish the release
        artifacts to GitHub, `Quay.io`, [ArtifactHub][] etc.

        ```bash
        cmrel publish --nomock --release-name <RELEASE_NAME>
        ```

        Note: At this stage there will be a draft release on GitHub and a
        live release on [ArtifactHub][]. So you must now complete the
        release process quickly otherwise users of the latest release on
        [ArtifactHub][] will encounter errors, because the manual CRD
        install URL will not be available yet.

   4. While the build is running, send a fourth Slack message in reply to
      the first message:

        _Follow the cmrel publish build: <https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds/b6fef12b-2e81-4486-9f1f-d00592351789?project=1021342095237>_

7. Publish the GitHub release

   1. Visit the draft GitHub release and paste in the release notes that you generated earlier.

        You will need to manually edit the content to match the style of earlier releases.
        In particular, remember to remove package-related changes.

   2. Tick the box "This is a pre-release" if your release is an alpha.
      (not necessary for final releases)

   3. Click "publish" to make the GitHub release live.
      This will create a Git tag automatically.

8.  Finally, post a Slack message as an answer to the first message. Toggle
   the check box "Also send to `#cert-manager-dev`" so that the message is
   well visible. Also cross-post the message on `#cert-manager`.

     _<https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/tag/v1.0.0> üéâ_

### Final Release

After releasing one or more alpha and beta releases,
you will release the final version.
For the final release, you should follow the process described above with the following changes and additional steps:

#### Full Release notes

The release notes for the final release should include all changes since the last minor release.

#### Rollover testing infra

After releasing the final release you will need to update the testing infrastructure,
so that it uses the latest release as `release-previous`,
and you will need to create a new release branch in the cert-manager repository which will be treated as `release-next`,
and both these branches will be tested periodically.

For example see the PR  [Prepare testing for the cert-manager `v1.0` release](https://github.com/cert-manager/testing/pull/397).

#### Rollover documentation

You will also need to update the versions and branches in the cert-manager website configuration.

For example see the PR [Configure website for the `v1.0` release](https://github.com/cert-manager/website/pull/309).

## Patch releases

A patch release contains critical bug fixes for the project.  They are managed on
an ad-hoc basis, and should only be required when critical bugs/regressions are
found in the release.

We will only perform patch release for the **current** version of cert-manager.

Once a new minor release has been cut, we will stop providing patches for the
version before it.

### Release schedule

Patch releases are cut on an ad-hoc basis, depending on recent activity on the
release branch.

### Process for releasing a patch version

The process for cutting a patch release is as follows:

1. Ensure that all PRs have been cherry-picked into the release branch, e.g. `release-1.0`

   Bugs that need to be fixed in a patch release should be [cherry picked into the appropriate release branch](../contributing-flow/#cherry-picking).

2. Then, continue with the instructions in [process for releasing a minor version](#process-for-releasing-a-minor-version).
