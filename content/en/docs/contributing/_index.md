## Welcome

Hello new or existing contributor!
Welcome to our contributors documentation, this is the place where we document all our processes
as well as how to compile, run and test cert-manager and all it's components.
This document sometimes can get out of date due to changes in the code and/or tooling. PRs to this part are
also very welcome if you happen to find an out of date part.

## Meetings

All the cert-manager meetings are open for everyone to join.
To get invites you can subscribe to [our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cert-manager-dev).

We have 2 regular repeating meetings
* our daily stand-up meetings [on Google Meet](

## Slack
We have two cert-manager channels on [the Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io) which we use to communicate:

* `cert-manager` a general users channel, use this one for any usage related questions.
* `cert-manager-dev` this is what the developers use to collaborate, please only use this for code related questions
