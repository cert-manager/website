## ca-injector

CA Injection Controller for Kubernetes (canary) ()

### Synopsis


cert-manager CA injector is a Kubernetes addon to automate the injection of CA data into
webhooks and APIServices from cert-manager certificates.

It will ensure that annotated webhooks and API services always have the correct
CA data from the referenced certificates, which can then be used to serve API
servers and webhook servers.

### Options

```
  -h, --help                                      help for ca-injector
      --leader-elect                              If true, cainjector will perform leader election between instances to ensure no more than one instance of cainjector operates at a time (default true)
      --leader-election-lease-duration duration   The duration that non-leader candidates will wait after observing a leadership renewal until attempting to acquire leadership of a led but unrenewed leader slot. This is effectively the maximum duration that a leader can be stopped before it is replaced by another candidate. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled. (default 15s)
      --leader-election-namespace string          Namespace used to perform leader election (defaults to controller's namespace). Only used if leader election is enabled
      --leader-election-renew-deadline duration   The interval between attempts by the acting master to renew a leadership slot before it stops leading. This must be less than or equal to the lease duration. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled. (default 10s)
      --leader-election-retry-period duration     The duration the clients should wait between attempting acquisition and renewal of a leadership. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled. (default 2s)
      --namespace string                          If set, this limits the scope of cainjector to a single namespace. If set, cainjector will not update resources with certificates outside of the configured namespace.
