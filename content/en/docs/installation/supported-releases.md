This page lists the status, timeline and policy for currently supported
releases.

Each release is supported for a period of four months, and we create a new
release every two months.

## Support policy

### What we mean by support

Our support window is four months for each release branch. In the below
diagram, `release-1.2` is an example of a release branch. The support
window corresponds to the two latest releases, given that we produce a new
final release every two months. We offer two types of support:

- [Technical support](#technical-support),
- [Security and bug fixes](#bug-fixes-support).

For example, imagining that the latest release is `v1.2.0`, you can expect
support for both `v1.2.0` and `v1.1.0`. Only the last patch release of each
branch is actually supported.

```diagram
   v1.0.0                                                          ^

### Technical support {#technical-support}

Technical assistance is offered on a best-effort basis for supported
releases only. You can request support from the community on [Kubernetes
Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) (in the `#cert-manager` channel), using
[GitHub Discussions][discussions] or using the [cert-manager-dev][group]
Google group.

[discussions]: https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/discussions
[group]: https://groups.google.com/g/cert-manager-dev

### Security and bug fixes {#bug-fixes-support}

We back-port important bug fixes — including security fixes — to all
currently supported releases.

- [Security issues](#security-issues),
- [Critical bugs](#critical-bugs),
- [Long-standing bugs](#long-standing-bugs).

#### Security issues {#security-issues}

**Security issues** are fixed as soon as possible. They get back-ported to
the last two releases, and a new patch release is immediately created for
them.

#### Critical bugs {#critical-bugs}

**Critical bugs** include both regression bugs as well as upgrade bugs.

Regressions are functionalities that worked in a previous release but no
longer work. [#3393][] and [#2857][] are two examples of regressions.

Upgrade bugs are issues (often Helm-related) preventing users from
upgrading to currently supported releases from earlier releases of
cert-manager. [#3882][] and [#3644][] are examples of upgrade bugs.

Note that [intentional breaking changes](#breaking-changes) do not belong
to this category.

Once merged to the master branch, fixes for critical bugs are not
immediately back-ported. Instead, we wait until the next final release for
triggering a patch release. The patch release will be made for all
supported release, but note that since we do only support the two last
releases, a single patch release is made for the last release.

In the example below, the release branches `release-1.2` and `release-1.3`
are the two supported releases at the time of the release of 1.3.0, which
means that critical bug fixes 1 and 2 will only be back-ported to
`release-1.2` and not to `release-1.1`:

```diagram
   v1.2.1                                v1.2.2
------+-------------------------------------+-----------> release-1.2

         \           /           /          | along with v1.3.0

```

#### Long-standing bugs {#long-standing-bugs}

**Long-standing bug**: sometimes a bug exists for a long time, and may have
known workarounds. [#3444][] is an example of a long-standing bug.

Where we feel that back-porting would be difficult or might be a stability
risk to clusters running cert-manager, we'll make the fix in a major
release but avoid back-porting the fix.

#### Breaking changes {#breaking-changes}

Breaking changes are changes that intentionally break the cert-manager
Kubernetes API or the command line flags. We avoid making breaking changes
where possible, and where they're required we'll give as much notice as
possible.

## How we determine supported Kubernetes versions {#kubernetes-supported-versions}

The list of supported Kubernetes versions displayed in the [Supported
Releases](#supported-releases) section depends on what the cert-manager
maintainers think is reasonable to support and to test.

Our testing coverage is:

| Release branch | Prow configuration            | Dashboard                 | Kubernetes versions tested   |  Periodicity  |

The oldest Kubernetes release supported by cert-manager is 1.16, as we want
to be supporting most commercial Kubernetes offerings.

## Terminology

The term "release" (or "minor release") refers to one minor version of
cert-manager. For example, 1.2 and 1.3 are two releases. Note that we do
not use the prefix `v` for releases (just "1.2"). This is because releases
are not used as git tags.

Patch releases use the `v` prefix (e.g., `v1.2.0`, `v1.3.1`...) since one
patch release = one git tag. The initial patch release is called "final
release":

| Type of release | Example of git tag | Corresponding release | Corresponding release branch\* |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Final release   | `v1.3.0`           | 1.3                   | `release-1.3`                  |
| Patch release   | `v1.3.1`           | 1.3                   | `release-1.3`                  |
| Pre-release     | `v1.4.0-alpha.0`   | N/A\*\*               | `release-1.4`                  |

\*For maintainers: each release has an associated long-lived branch that we
call the “release branch”. For example, `release-1.2` is the release branch
for release 1.2.

\*\*Pre-releases (e.g., `v1.3.0-alpha.0`) don't have a corresponding
release (e.g., 1.3) since a release only exists after a final release
(e.g., `v1.3.0`) has been created.

Our naming scheme mostly follows [Semantic Versioning
2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with `v` prepended to git tags and docker
images:

```plain
v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

where `<minor>` is increased for each release, and `<patch>` counts the
number of patches for the current `<minor>` release. A patch is usually a
small change relative to the `<minor>` release.
