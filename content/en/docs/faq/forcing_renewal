If you need to force the renewal of your certificates, then you can simply delete
the certificate in your kubernetes cluster and cert-manager will get a new one
(tested with cert-manager 0.9.1).

The certificate will be in a kubernetes secret. **Take care not to remove the wrong secret**:
there can be multiple secrets of the same name in different namespaces! Before deleting the
secret you can have a look at it with `kubectl get secret name_of_your_secret -o yaml`. It
should have an entry named `tls.crt` which is the certificate that was issued to you.
