`kubectl cert-manager` is a [kubectl
plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/) that
can help you to manage cert-manager resources inside your cluster.

While the kubectl plugin is supported, it is recommended to use
[cmctl](./cmctl.md) as this enables a better experience via tab auto-completion.

## Installation
You need the `kubectl-cert-manager.tar.gz` file for the platform you're using, these can be found on our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases).
In order to use the kubectl plugin you need its binary to be accessible under the name `kubectl-cert_manager` in your `$PATH`.
Run the following commands to set up the plugin:
```console
$ curl -L -o kubectl-cert-manager.tar.gz https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/kubectl-cert_manager-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar xzf kubectl-cert-manager.tar.gz
$ sudo mv kubectl-cert_manager /usr/local/bin
```

You can run `kubectl cert-manager help` to test the plugin is set up properly:
```console
$ kubectl cert-manager help

otherwise.
