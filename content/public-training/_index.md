## Description

Open Sourced by Google in mid-2014 ‘Kubernetes’ builds on 10 years of managing Linux Containers at massive scale.

Since then the Kubernetes project has exploded, gaining over 30,000 commits and 46,600+ stars on Github. It has quickly become the default cluster manager, referred to as the new ‘Datacentre OS.’ Kubernetes is a must to learn if you are using or adopting containers.

These are hands-on modular courses that will train you in deploying Kubernetes and operating it efficiently, whatever your level of experience. This is a FREE workshop hosted by Google, run by Jetstack. Lunch is provided. 

To attend you must:  

* Register with company email address 
* Either be working on or about to start working on an active Docker/Kubernetes project 
* Demonstrate a skill level consistent with the course level specification (see below) 
* Be able to travel and attend course in London 

_Note: No more than two attendees from the same company in one workshop._

**Please register your interest and we will confirm your attendance based on availability.**
